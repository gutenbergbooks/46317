<h1>ELLA CLINTON<br />

OR<br />

"BY THEIR FRUITS YE SHALL KNOW THEM."</h1>

<hr class="r5" />

<h2>CHAPTER I.</h2>


<p>"<span class="smcap">Ella</span>, you are the most provoking child
that ever was born. You can never let a
thing alone, but must have your fingers in
everything. You've no more idea of neatness
than old Tabby; no, nor half so much.
You come in from school, and bonnet goes
here, and book there. It's no use to talk
to you, and one might run after you all
day, and then couldn't keep the house to
rights. I declare, you're enough to try the
patience of Job!" So saying, Aunt Prudence
set herself energetically to work, to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">[4]</a></span>
put to rights the work-basket which poor
Ella had most unfortunately disarranged.
"I should like to know," she continued,
"what children were ever made for. I'm
sure they're nothing but bother and trouble,
from week's end to week's end."</p>

<p>Poor Ella darted up stairs to her own
room, and throwing herself upon the bed,
burst into a fit of passionate weeping.</p>

<p>"I hate Aunt Prudence! I hate her, so
I do! She's always scolding and slapping
me. I wish <i>she</i> was dead instead of mother.
O mother, mother! why, O why, did you
die and leave me? I can't be good without
you. I do try to be good, but Aunt Prudence
always makes me naughty. I can't
help hating her when she's so cross. O
mother, mother! come back, come back!"</p>

<p>Poor little Ella was an orphan; though
she could remember a time when she had
had a kind father and mother who loved
her dearly, and tried to teach her to do<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_5" id="Page_5">[5]</a></span>
what was right; but her father had been
lost at sea, and her mother, who had never
seemed well after she had heard of the loss
of the vessel, had now been lying for nearly
a year in the graveyard of the little town
where Aunt Prudence and Ella lived. Ella
was naturally a very warm-hearted, affectionate
child, but careless, thoughtless and
meddlesome; faults which, to Aunt Prudence,
with her precise ways and strict notions
of propriety and neatness, seemed
most inexcusable. She really loved the
desolate child who had been left to her
care, but she had her own way of showing it.
She was careful to provide the little girl
with all that she considered necessary for
her comfort, and, as she said, took a great
deal of pains to teach her habits of neatness
and order; but Ella, even more than most
children, needed "line upon line, and precept
upon precept," and her aunt's patience
was apt to be soon exhausted. Ella's mother<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">[6]</a></span>
had always taken a great deal of pains to
correct her faults, but she was very patient;
always talked with her about the folly and
wickedness of her behaviour, and tried to
make her see the reasonableness of her requirements;
and when she punished her,
she did it in such a way as to convince the
child that it was done for her good, and
not because her mother was in a passion.
But now, when Ella tore her frock,
meddled with what did not belong to her,
or what she had been told not to touch, left
her things lying about the room, or did
anything else that was naughty, Aunt Prudence
would scold her in loud, angry tones,
calling her "the most provoking, troublesome
child that ever was born," or perhaps
box her ears, and send her out of the room.
When her mother punished her, Ella had
always felt sorry for her faults, and determined
to try to do better, but Aunt Prudence's
angry, impatient way was apt to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">[7]</a></span>
rouse her naturally quick temper, and sometimes
she flew into a passion, which only
served to convince her aunt that she really
was a very wicked child.</p>

<p>Then when Ella, her passion over, would
come full of penitence to her aunt's side, to
put her arms round her neck, as she used
to do to her mother, and say how sorry she
was, aunt Prudence would push her from
her, saying, "Go away, Ella, I don't want
such a wicked little girl near me. You're
the most ungrateful child that ever I saw.
If it wasn't for me, you wouldn't have a
roof to cover your head, nor a bite of
victuals to put in your mouth, nor a rag to
your back; for your father didn't leave you
a dollar, and yet whenever I try to do my
duty, and make a good girl of you, you fly
into a most dreadful passion. No, just go
away out of my sight; I don't want any
kisses from such a wicked child!"</p>

<p>Sometimes such treatment would cause a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[8]</a></span>
second fit of rage, and sometimes it sent
her to her mother's grave, to throw herself
upon it and weep as though her heart would
break.</p>

<p>We left Ella, this afternoon, crying by
herself in her own little room. At first
they were all angry tears; but, though a
quick-tempered child, her passion never
lasted very long. She had been accustomed
to go to her mother with all her little troubles,
and very bitterly did she feel the loss
of that dear friend, when in need of sympathy
and kindness. Her present trouble
made her long for her mother, and then as
her angry feelings subsided, she began to
think of that mother's reproofs and instructions.
How often had she warned her of
the great wickedness of indulging her temper,
and entreated her to try to govern it!
How often she had talked to her of the
kindness of her aunt in taking her, a poor,
friendless, penniless child into her house,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">[9]</a></span>
and providing for her, and of the duty of
obeying and trying to please her! Ella
could not feel that her aunt was very kind,
for she was always scolding and punishing
her, but still her conscience told her she
had done very wrong, and that she ought
to obey and love her aunt, and as she
thought of all this, she wept tears of real
penitence, and made many resolutions to
behave better in future.</p>

<p>"I will tell aunt Prudence I am sorry,
and will try never to be so naughty again;
just as I used to tell mamma, my own dear
mamma," said she to herself.</p>

<p>"Ella!" called out the shrill, sharp voice
of her aunt from the foot of the stairs,
"Ella, come down here this <i>minute</i>, and
get your supper. What in the world are
you staying up there all this time in the
cold for? To catch a cold, and give me the
trouble of nursing you through a spell of
sickness, I suppose."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[10]</a></span></p>

<p>Ella rose and went down into the dining
room with the full intention of acknowledging
her faults, and asking forgiveness; but
aunt Prudence looked so cold and stern,
that when she tried to speak, the words
seemed to stick in her throat. The meal
passed off in almost total silence, and Ella
was glad when it was over. Her aunt
spoke to her but once, and then it was to
scold her for spilling her tea.</p>

<p>Ella cried herself to sleep that night
thinking of her mother, and her first
thought, on waking next morning, was that
she was going to be very good all day, and
not make aunt Prudence scold her once.
But alas, poor child! she forgot to pray for
help to keep her good resolutions. It was
late when she waked, and she dressed in
great haste lest she should not be ready for
breakfast, for which her aunt would certainly
have punished her. She said her
prayers, it is true, for she had been too well<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[11]</a></span>
taught to think of omitting them altogether,
but she hurried through them with very little
thought of what she was saying, so that
she really did not pray at all, for "God is
a spirit, and they that worship him, must
worship him in spirit, and in truth," and
he will not hear nor answer the prayer
which comes from the lips only.</p>

<p>Children, if you wish to be kept from sin,
to be enabled to perform the duties of the
day in a proper manner, never dare to begin
it without sincere prayer to God for his
assistance; and Oh! wherever you are, at
home, at school, in the street, at your studies,
or at your play, remember that the eye
of God is upon you, that he notices all
your words and actions, and that you will
have to give an account to him for all that
you do and say, and for the manner in
which you perform every duty.</p>

<p>Breakfast over, Ella prepared for school.
Taking her satchel of books, and her dinner<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[12]</a></span>
basket,&mdash;for the school was at some distance,
and she usually carried her dinner
in cold weather,&mdash;and bidding her aunt
good morning, she set off.</p>

<p>It was the district school which Ella attended,
and it was usually taught by a man
in the winter and a lady in the summer.
Mr. Burton was the name of the present
teacher. He was not remarkable for patience,
and was sometimes very severe.
The school was nearly a quarter of a mile
from Ella's home. She walked along
briskly enough, until she had gone rather
more than half way, but then having
reached a pond where the children of the
village were in the habit of skating and sliding
in their play-hours, she said to herself,
"It was only half-past eight when I started;
I'm sure I might take time to slide a little
while. To be sure Mr. Burton says we must
never stop to play by the way, but then I
shall only stay a very few minutes, and if<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[13]</a></span>
I get to school in time, it won't make any
difference; so I'll just lay my books and
my dinner down on this snow bank, and
have a real good slide all by myself."</p>

<p>Time flies very rapidly when children are
playing, and while the rest of Mr. Burton's
pupils were entering the school-house in
answer to the bell, Ella was taking just one
more and one more slide across the pond.
She was on the side opposite to the one
where she had left her books, when she
suddenly perceived a dog at her dinner basket.
She made all the haste she could, but
he was too quick for her, and was off with
the contents of the basket before she reached
the place. She chased him for a long distance,
for she felt quite unwilling to lose
her dinner, but at length he was quite out
of sight, and she gave it up in despair. All
out of breath with running, she returned
to the spot where she had left her books,
and picking them up, hurried on to school,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[14]</a></span>
for she now began to be quite frightened at
the thought that it must be long past school
time, and thinking to shorten her walk by
going across a field, she climbed the fence,
but in doing so caught her dress and tore a
long slit which she must stop to pin up, and
that took her much longer than it would
have done to go by the road. She had at
last almost reached the school-house, when
she was met by two of the scholars who
were going for water.</p>

<p>"Has school commenced, girls?" asked
Ella.</p>

<p>"Yes! nearly an hour ago, I should
think," said Sally Barnes.  "How on earth
did you come to be so late? You'll catch it,
I can tell you; for the master's got the
headache this morning, and he's as cross as
a bear."</p>

<p>Ella burst into tears. "Oh!" said she,
"I just stopped a few minutes to play on
the ice, and then a dog ran away with my<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[15]</a></span>
dinner, and I had to run after him. O
dear! what shall I do? I wish I had come
straight to school."</p>

<p>"Never mind, Ellie," said Mary Young,
who was a very kind-hearted girl, and felt
sorry to see her cry, "you can just tell him
that your aunt sent you on an errand, and
you couldn't get back any sooner."</p>

<p>"But that would be telling a lie, Mary,
and I could never do that," replied Ella,
for with all her faults she was a perfectly
truthful child. "My mother always told
me it was a dreadful sin to say what was
not true, and when she was dying she told
me never, never to tell a lie. Oh no, I
wouldn't tell him that to keep him from killing
me."</p>

<p>"Oh, let her alone, Mary," said Sally,
"if she fancies a whipping, I'm sure she's
welcome to it for all I care. But come
along or we'll catch it too."</p>

<p>"You had better take my advice, Ellie,"
said Mary, turning to go.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[16]</a></span></p>

<p>Ella hung up her bonnet and cloak in the
hall, entered the school room, and went to
her seat as softly as possible, in hope that
the teacher would not notice her. Vain
hope!</p>

<p>"Ella Clinton!" he called out in his
sternest tones, "come here to me." Trembling
with fear she obeyed. "Do you know
what time it is, miss?" said he, looking at
his watch. "Ten minutes to ten; nearly
an hour past school time. Where have you
been?"</p>

<p>Poor Ella caught at the desk for support.
The room was so still that the ticking of
the watch could be distinctly heard.</p>

<p>All were waiting in breathless silence for
her answer.</p>

<p>"Speak!" thundered the master, "where
have you been?"</p>

<p>"I stopped to slide a little on the ice,
and"&mdash;</p>

<p>"You did, did you? I'll teach you to do<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[17]</a></span>
that again. Hold out your hand here. I'll
make an example of you. You needn't
think you'll escape a flogging because you're
a girl," and taking hold of her little tender
hand, he brought his heavy ruler down upon
it again and again, until the palm was all
blistered, and then sent her to her seat
without one word of commendation for
having told the truth.</p>

<p>"I say, Jim," whispered one boy to another,
"that's what folks get for telling the
truth."</p>

<p>"What are you whispering about there,
sir?" called out the teacher.</p>

<p>"I wasn't whispering; I was just saying,
the lesson over to myself."</p>

<p>"Well, sir, keep your eyes on the book
when you move your lips, or I shall flog
you for whispering."</p>

<p>"I'm not going to be such a fool as to
tell on myself just to get a licking," muttered
the boy, with his eyes fixed on the
book.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[18]</a></span></p>

<p>Poor Ella! everything seemed to go
wrong with her that day. So much time
had been lost, and her mind was so taken
up with her troubles, that it seemed impossible
to learn her lessons, and she failed in
every one; for which she was of course
punished. She lost her place, and was in
disgrace all day. She would have been
without her dinner also, if some of her kind-hearted
schoolmates had not shared with
her. Oh, how long the day seemed! but
it was over at last; school was dismissed,
and Ella walked slowly and sadly homeward,
dreading the moment when aunt
Prudence should learn the sad accident
which had befallen her dress. She was
considering, as she walked along, what
would be her wisest course of action, and
remembering that her mother had often
told her, if she would come and inform her
immediately of an accident, without any
attempt at concealment or deception, she<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[19]</a></span>
would not punish her; she thought she
would try that plan with her aunt. For
once, Ella remembered to put her hood and
cloak, her satchel and dinner-basket, in
their places. She then entered the sitting-room,
where Miss Prudence sat in her easy-chair
beside the fire, stitching away industriously
as usual. She looked up from her
work as Ella opened the door, and exclaimed:&mdash;</p>

<p>"Why, Ella Clinton! where have you
been, and what have you been about, to
get that great, long slit in your dress?
Come here to me this instant, and tell me
how you tore it."</p>

<p>"I was just climbing a fence, aunt Prudence,"
sobbed the child, "and it caught
and tore."</p>

<p>"Climbing a fence! and what were you
doing that for, I'd like to know? Do you
think I'm made of money, and have nothing
to do with it but to spend it in buying<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[20]</a></span>
dresses for you to tear up this way? You
haven't worn that dress three weeks, and
just look at it now; nearly ruined. You're
always climbing fences and trees. A perfect
tom-boy you are, besides being the
most careless, troublesome, ungrateful child
I ever laid my eyes on. But I'll see if I
can't put a stop to it. You shall just sit
down here, and darn that yourself, and do
it well too, and not a mouthful of victuals
shall you have until it's done; and you deserve
a good switching before you go to
bed. Now just stop your crying, for I'll
not have it."</p>

<p>It was very late before Ella got her supper
that night, for darning was a new business
to her, the rent was a very long one,
aunt Prudence very particular, and she
herself, after all the labours and troubles
of the day, very weary, and fingers and
eyes ached sadly, long before the task was
accomplished.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[21]</a></span></p>

<p>"It's no use to try to be good," sobbed
the poor child to herself, as she wet her
pillow with her tears. "I did mean to be
good to-day, but the more I try, the more
I can't. Oh, mother, mother, I can't be
good without you! I wish I was dead too,
and I do believe aunt Prudence wishes I
was. I don't believe she loves me at all,
for she never kisses me, nor calls me her
dear little girl, like you used to, and she's
always scolding me, and calling me bad
and troublesome."</p>

<p>Ella did not stop to play on the way,
next morning, but went directly to school;
nor did she climb fences or trees again for
some time, but still she was almost always
in disgrace, and continually getting punished,
both at home and at school, for there
was scarcely a day that she did not fail in
one or more of her lessons, or forget or lose
something; either her book, pen, pencil or
ink.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[22]</a></span></p>

<p>At last Mr. Burton called upon her aunt to
complain of her carelessness and indolence.
"I can't help it, Mr. Burton," said aunt
Prudence; "I've tried as hard as ever anybody
could, to make her orderly and industrious,
but I can't do it. She's a very bad
child I know, but I can't help it. I'm sure
I've done my duty. There's never a day
passes over my head, that I don't give her
a scolding or may be a whipping, but it don't
seem to do a bit of good; indeed I believe
she grows worse instead of better. She's
enough to try the patience of Job, as I
often tell her, and such an awful temper as
she has got! you never saw any thing like
it. I used to think she was a tolerably
good child while her mother was living, but
there's no doing any thing with her lately.
The more I scold and punish her, the worse
she seems to grow: I don't see that she'll
ever be good for any thing, but there's one
comfort, I've done my duty by her."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[23]</a></span></p>

<p>It was very true; Ella <i>was</i> growing
worse and worse.  She made many resolutions
to do better, but try as hard as she
might, aunt Prudence never seemed to notice
it; never gave her a word of praise
or encouragement, and always found something
to scold her for, and so the poor child
grew discouraged, and gave up trying.
"It's no use to try to be good, and please
aunt Prudence," she would say to herself,
"for she always scolds me just the same.
Mother used to smile, and tell me she was
glad to see me trying to do right, and then
it seemed easier, but aunt Prudence never
does, and I won't try to <i>please</i> her any
more."</p>

<p>One morning Ella reached the school
room unusually early; it still wanted nearly
an hour to school time, and there were
but two other scholars present.  A few
moments had been spent in talking together,
when Ella, who had been walking about,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[24]</a></span>
looking into the desks, suddenly exclaimed,
"Why Mr. Burton has left his desk unlocked!
O girls, let's play school! I'll be
teacher and have you for my scholars."</p>

<p>The others assented. I have told you
that one of Ella's faults was a habit of
meddling with other people's things.</p>

<p>She now proceeded to take out Mr. Burton's
inkstand, copper-plate copies, ruler,
&amp;c., and place them on the outside of the
desk.</p>

<p>"Oh! Ella!" exclaimed Rachel Frost,
"aren't you afraid to touch Mr. Burton's
things?  Why he'll whip you like everything
if he finds it out."</p>

<p>"Oh, but he won't know it, Rachel, for
I'll put them all back before he comes, and
I know you and Louisa won't tell."</p>

<p>"No, of course we won't; but you'd
better take care, or he may come in and
catch you."</p>

<p>"No danger," said Ella, "he never<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[25]</a></span>
comes more than ten minutes before school
time." And secure in this confidence, she
went on playing teacher until in bringing
down the ruler upon the desk, in imitation
of Mr. Burton when he would call out
"Silence!" to the scholars, she accidentally
hit the inkstand.</p>

<p>The glass was shivered by the blow, and
in an instant the black streams were running
over the desk, and the copies.</p>

<p>Poor Ella was terribly frightened. "Oh!
what shall I do?  what shall I do?" she
exclaimed, bursting into tears. "Oh! I wish
I hadn't been meddling."</p>

<p>Her schoolmates were very sorry for her,
and did all they could to help and comfort
her, but the mischief could not be undone.</p>

<p>They wiped up the ink, as well as they
could, and replaced the ruler and the copies
in the desk. When all this had been
done, Louisa said, "Now come, girls, let's
go off somewhere till school time, and Mr.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[26]</a></span>
Burton will never know who did it. He'll
may be think it was Jonas Hand, because,
you know, he always makes the fires and
sweeps the room."</p>

<p>"But I don't want him to think it was
Jonas," said Ella, "it wouldn't be right for
me to let Jonas be punished for what I
did."</p>

<p>"But," said Rachel, "I don't believe he
will punish Jonas, because he'll tell him he
didn't do it, and there's no need for Mr.
Burton ever to know <i>who</i> did it. The door
is always left unlocked in the morning, and
it might have been somebody who doesn't
belong to the school at all. So come along,
Ellie, for if you are found here you'll be
suspected, and you'll not deny it I know,
and I can't bear to see you whipped."</p>

<p>Ella yielded, for she trembled with fright
at the thought of Mr. Burton's wrath,
when he should discover the mischief she
had done. They walked away a short distance<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[27]</a></span>
to a place, where they were out of
sight, but not out of hearing of the bell,
and there they remained until they heard
it ring for school. Then hurrying in, along
with the others, they seated themselves and
tried to look as though nothing had happened.
Ella took out her book and seemed
to be unusually intent upon her lesson; but
though her eyes were fixed upon the page,
the words conveyed no meaning to her
mind; so much were her thoughts taken up
with the events of the morning.</p>

<p>"Attention!" said Mr. Burton in a
voice which made every scholar start;
"some one has been at my desk meddling
with its contents; a thing which I have
positively forbidden and shall severely punish.
Can any of you tell me who it was?"</p>

<p>"It wasn't me;" and "It wasn't me;"
"I don't know anything about it;" "I
just now came in," answered one and another.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[28]</a></span></p>

<p>"Silence!" exclaimed the teacher angrily,
bringing his ruler down on the desk
with a loud crack. "I didn't ask who didn't
do it, but who <i>did</i>. Jonas Hand, come forward
here, sir, and you Mary Young, and
Sallie Barnes, and Henry Harris. You
were the only scholars here when I came,
and it must be that you know who did this
mischief." They tremblingly obeyed, but
each and all protested their own innocence,
and their utter ignorance of the author of
the mischief.</p>

<p>"I say it <i>must</i> have been <i>one</i> of you,"
said Mr. Burton, "and the sooner you confess,
the better it will be for you. Which
of you did it?" There was no reply. Mr.
Burton was growing pale with passion.
"Tell me instantly," said he, "which of
you it was, or I shall let you know that I'm
not to be trifled with. Which of you got
here first?"</p>

<p>"We all came about the same time,"<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[29]</a></span>
said Mary Young, "Jonas and Harry had
just reached the gate, as Sallie and I came
round the fence corner, and I think the
mischief must have been done before that,
sir, for I'm sure it wasn't done afterwards."</p>

<p>"You needn't expect me to believe that,"
said Mr. Burton; "I know very well it was
one of you four, and you've just entered
into a conspiracy to shield the guilty one;
but I'll fix you. You shall tell me instantly
which of you did it, or I'll give every one
of you such a flogging as you never had
before. Now I'll give you just three minutes
to make up your minds;" he added,
taking out his watch.</p>

<p>The room was still as death, save the
tick, ticking of the watch, and an occasional
sob from Sallie Barnes, who had
covered her face with her apron, and was crying
heartily. Mary Young stood with her
head erect, her cheeks burning, and her eyes
flashing with indignation. Jonas looked<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[30]</a></span>
frightened and despairing, Harry indignant
and defiant. Meantime a fierce struggle
was going on in Ella's breast. Should she
sit by and see others punished for what was
her fault alone? or should she expose herself
to certain and severe chastisement by
confessing her guilt? It was a hard choice.
Her whole frame trembled with the violence
of her emotions. One instant she was
ready to start up and confess her fault; the
next, she trembled at the thought of the
punishment which would be sure to follow.</p>

<p>"The three minutes are up," said Mr.
Burton, taking up his ruler, and catching
Jonas by the arm; "what have you to say
for yourselves now?"</p>

<p>"I didn't do it, sir, indeed I didn't; don't
whip me," gasped poor Jonas.</p>

<p>"Who did then, you scoundrel?" exclaimed
the teacher, at the same time striking
him with all his force, "who did it?
answer me that."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[31]</a></span></p>

<p>Ella could bear no more; she sprang
from her seat, and the next instant she
was beside the angry man, saying, "Don't!
Oh! don't whip him, Mr. Burton, I did it."</p>

<p>"You did it, did you?" he exclaimed, as,
pushing Jonas aside, he caught hold of her,
and shook her violently. "Yes, I might
have known it was you, the most meddlesome,
troublesome scholar in the school;
but I'll teach you how to meddle with <i>my</i>
things!"</p>

<p>"Oh! I'll never do it again; indeed,
<i>indeed</i> I won't," said Ella.</p>

<p>"No, I think you won't," sneered the
angry man, "for I'll give you such a dressing,
as you won't want again in a hurry."</p>

<p>Never, in all her life, had Ella had such
a terrible whipping. It was several weeks
before she entirely recovered from its effects.
Aunt Prudence was very angry indeed,
when she heard an account of the
matter.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[32]</a></span></p>

<p>"Nobody," she said, "should abuse her
brother's child so. She was bad, she knew,
but that was no reason why she should be
half killed. She would sue Mr. Burton for
damages, and make him pay well for it,
and Ella should never go another step to
that school while he taught it. She wasn't
going to have her murdered, just for spilling
a little ink. Mr. Burton isn't fit to teach!"
she continued; "a man that can't govern
his temper better than that, and treat children
like human beings, instead of like
brutes, isn't fit to have the control of them.
For my part, if I could have my way, he
should be sent to the State's prison; it
would only be too good for him. And you,
Ella, you're the most foolish child that ever
was seen! Why on earth couldn't you let
the man's things alone? and when you had
done the mischief, why need you go and
tell on yourself?  You'd a great deal better
have let those great boys and girls take the
whipping, for they were a great deal better<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[33]</a></span>
able to bear it, and besides, it would have
been divided amongst the four of them."</p>

<p>"But, aunt Prudence, it wouldn't have
been right to let them be punished for what
<i>I</i> did; and besides, poor Jonas gets so many
beatings at home from his drunken father,
and Mary Young is always so kind to me.
Oh! I couldn't <i>bear</i> to see them whipped
for what was my fault!"</p>

<p>"Nonsense, child!" said aunt Prudence;
but she turned her back to Ella and wiped
her eyes, and she was kinder to the poor,
motherless child that evening, than she had
ever been before. She actually put her
arms around her, and kissed her.</p>

<p>"O aunt Prudence!" exclaimed Ella,
her face beaming with delight, "I could
almost thank Mr. Burton for whipping me
so hard; it makes you so kind."</p>

<p>"You're thankful for very small favours
then, I think," said aunt Prudence, getting
up and going to the other side of the room
to set a chair in its place.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER II.</h2>


<p><span class="smcap">Spring</span> had come with its soft, warm
breezes, the grass was springing up fresh
and green, the trees were putting forth
their leaves, the woods were full of violets
and anemones, and the little birds, while
busy building their nests, were filling the
air with their happy songs of praise. The
winter term of school was over; Mr. Burton
had left, and the children had holidays
for a few weeks, until it should be time for
the summer school to commence. Ella rejoiced
in the return of spring. She had
been confined to the house for several weeks,
until both she and her aunt were heartily
tired of it, but now she was quite well
again, and able to run about, and keenly<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[35]</a></span>
did she enjoy the privilege of rambling
through the woods in search of wild flowers,
or working in the little spot of ground
which her aunt had given her in the corner
of the garden, digging up the soft earth
and planting roots and flower seeds; and
in these employments she was, to her great
delight, allowed to spend most of her time,
because, as aunt Prudence said, "She was
glad to get her out of the house, for there
was no such thing as keeping it to rights
when she was in it."</p>

<p>"Why, Ellie child, what are you doing
there?"</p>

<p>It was Mary Young who spoke. She
had been taking a walk, and on her way
home passed through the graveyard, that
being her shortest route, and in so doing
she had come suddenly and unexpectedly
upon Ella, who was seated upon the ground,
with a trowel in her hand and a small basket
beside her. Ella, looking up and showing
a face all wet with tears, answered:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[36]</a></span></p>

<p>"Planting violets on mother's grave."</p>

<p>"And watering them with your tears,
you poor little thing," said Mary, sitting
down and putting her arms around the
child.  "Ellie dear, I wish for your sake,
that your mother was alive; that aunt Prudence
of yours isn't very kind to you, is
she?"</p>

<p>"No, not like mother was. O Mary, I
do want to see my mother so bad," sobbed
the poor child, laying her head on Mary's
shoulder, "and aunt Prudence says I never
will if I don't be good, and I can't be good
without mother.  Somehow, I'm almost always
bad now-a-days."</p>

<p>"Why, Ellie, I don't think you're so
very bad. I'm sure you don't tell lies like
some children I know. You always speak
the truth, even when you know that you'll
be punished. I know you used to play and
whisper in school sometimes, and blot your
copy-book, or spill ink on your copy, or<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">[37]</a></span>
lose your books or pencil, or forget to bring
them to school, and I know Mr. Burton
used to get very angry, and scold and whip
you, and to be sure it was naughty, but I
don't think it was so <i>very</i> wicked; not half
so bad, I'm sure, as telling lies."</p>

<p>"But, Mary, you told me to tell a lie
one day when I came late to school; what
made you do that, if you think it is so
wicked?"</p>

<p>"Oh, because I didn't like to have you
get whipped; I knew Mr. Burton would
whip you so hard, and besides, I thought it
wasn't a very bad story, because it wouldn't
do any body any harm&mdash;only save you from
a beating."</p>

<p>"Yes; but I remember my mother told
me never, never to tell a lie; that it was
very wicked, even if it didn't do any body
any harm. But those are not all the
naughty things I do, Mary; I'm always
forgetting not to meddle, and always<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[38]</a></span>
leaving my things about, and then when
aunt Prudence scolds me, and boxes my
ears, I get so angry, I feel as if I could
almost kill her."</p>

<p>"O my! Ellie! that is very wicked; I
didn't think you were so bad as that."</p>

<p>"Yes, I know it's very wicked, for I remember
how mother used to talk to me
about governing my temper, and that she
said, when I got so angry, it was the same
as being a murderer; but I can't help it;
when aunt Prudence gets so mad, it always
makes me mad too."</p>

<p>"Well, now, I wonder if it isn't just as
wicked for her, as it is for you," said Mary.</p>

<p>"Oh, but she's grown up, you know;
and I'm only a little girl."</p>

<p>"Well what of that? The Bible doesn't
say big people may get angry, but little
people mus'n't do it."</p>

<p>"No," said Ella, "I never heard that it
did, and I know my mamma didn't get<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">[39]</a></span>
angry like aunt Prudence, but I never
thought about it being wicked for her. But,
O Mary, I wish I had somebody to help me
to be good!"</p>

<p>"I would like to help you if I could,
Ellie, but I'm just as bad as you are," said
Mary. "I've heard people talking about
getting good by praying, but I never tried
it, so I can't tell you how it would do, but
perhaps Miss Layton can when she comes."</p>

<p>"Miss Layton! who is she?" asked
Ella.</p>

<p>"Haven't you heard about her? she's
the new teacher, and they say she's very
pious and good."</p>

<p>"Is she? when is she to come, Mary?"</p>

<p>"Week after next. Aren't you going to
school, Ellie?"</p>

<p>"Yes, aunt Prudence says she is tired
enough of having me about, and I shall go
as soon as ever school begins again. I hope
Miss Layton won't be as cross as Mr. Burton
was; don't you, Mary?"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">[40]</a></span></p>

<p>"Yes I do, and I know one thing, if she
is as cross, she can't be very pious, for the
Bible says people ought to be kind and patient,
and it says, 'By their fruits ye shall
know them,' so I'm sure if they don't try
to govern their tempers, they can't be
Christians."</p>

<p>"Aunt Prudence is kind about some
things, Mary," said Ella, going on with her
work, "she gave me a corner of her garden
for my own, and she lets me work in it a
great deal, and gives me all the seeds I
want, and she lets me come here whenever
I please, though she does think it is very
foolish, and she gave me that rose bush to
plant at mother's feet, and sent Jake, our
gardener, to plant that willow tree. There I
have planted all my violets, and I must go
now, for it's almost tea time, and aunt Prudence
won't like it if I'm late. Won't you
call for me on the first school day, Mary? I
don't like to go alone."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">[41]</a></span></p>

<p>"Yes; good bye, Ellie."</p>

<p>"Good bye, Mary."</p>

<p>Ella looked forward to the commencement
of school with mingled feelings. She
thought a great deal of what Mary Young
had said about Miss Layton, and wondered
if she were anything like her mamma, and
if she would really help her to be good.
She sometimes felt as if she could hardly
wait for the time to come, that she might
satisfy herself on these points; and sometimes
she wished vacation was longer&mdash;it
was so much pleasanter to work in her
garden, or wander about in the woods and
fields gathering spring flowers, than to be
shut up in the school room, and obliged
to learn lessons.</p>

<p>The long looked for day had come at
last. Nine o'clock was the hour, but Mary
and Ella set off for the school room a little
after eight, that they might be sure to be
in season. It was a lovely morning and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">[42]</a></span>
they enjoyed their walk very much. Though
it was still quite early when they reached
the school-house, they found it already half-filled
with girls and boys, some seated on
the benches, others collected in little groups
here and there, talking in whispers to each
other, while many a curious glance was
sent across the room to the teacher's desk,
where sat a pleasant-looking young lady,
with a blank book before her, in which she
was writing down the children's names.</p>

<p>"Come let's give her our names," said
Mary, pulling Ella forwards as she spoke.</p>

<p>"You are scholars, I suppose," said Miss
Layton, looking kindly at them; "what
are your names?"</p>

<p>"Mine is Mary Young, and this is Ella
Clinton."</p>

<p>The teacher wrote their names in the
book, and then asked where their parents
lived. Mary told her where hers resided,
and then said, "Ellie has no parents, but<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">[43]</a></span>
lives with her aunt, Miss Prudence Clinton,
in the same street that we live in."</p>

<p>"So you are an orphan, my poor child!"
said Miss Layton, drawing the little girl to
her, and kissing her cheek, "I know how
to pity you, for I am one also; but we have
a kind heavenly Father, Ellie, who, if we
put our trust in him, will never leave nor
forsake us."</p>

<p>Ella's heart was full; no one had ever
spoken so kindly to her since her mother's
death, and she longed to throw her arms
around the lady's neck, and ask her to love
her, and teach her to be good; but she was
a rather timid child, and afraid to venture.
She turned hastily away, and walked to her
seat, where she laid her head on her desk,
to hide the tears that <i>would</i> come, she
hardly knew why.</p>

<p>When Miss Layton had written down all
the names, she rung the bell, and the children
took their seats. She waited a moment,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[44]</a></span>
until the slight bustle attending the
movement was over, and all were quiet;
she then said, "I wish you all to give me
your attention; I have a few words to say
to you before we begin our school. Dear
children, we have met together this morning,
for the first time as teacher and
scholars; most of your faces I have never
seen before; but we expect to spend some
months in each other's society, and it is
very desirable that we should begin and
carry on our intercourse in a manner that
will make it both pleasant and profitable to
us all. But for any community of people
to be able to live pleasantly together, it is
necessary for them to have some form of
government. There must be a head; some
one to direct and control, or there will be
endless quarrelling and confusion. Now,
in a school, that place is naturally and properly
filled by the teacher. Your parents,
my dear children, have sent you here to be<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">[45]</a></span>
under my care; it will be my duty to direct
your studies, and do all that I can for your
mental and moral improvement, to treat
you with kindness and forbearance, and to
require of you only such things as are just
and reasonable. It will be your duty to
obey me, to be kindly affectioned one toward
another, and to improve your time by steady
industry. In short, it will be the duty of
each of us, to be 'diligent in business, fervent
in spirit, serving the Lord.' God, my
dear children, has given to each of us a
work to do, and he will take notice of, and
one day call us to account for, the manner
in which we perform our allotted tasks. If
we are God's children, we will strive to
serve and please him; and if we strive to
do our duty because we wish to please him,
we are really and truly engaged in his service.
The more you know, my dear children,
the more good you will be able to do
in this world; now is the time for you to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">[46]</a></span>
gain knowledge, and that is the work which
God has given you to do; and the work he
has given me, is to do all in my power to
assist you in gaining that knowledge, which
is to prepare you for future usefulness. I
do not wish you to attend to your studies,
as many children do, from fear of punishment,
but from love to God and an earnest
desire to please him; and I can assure you
that if you act from that motive, you will
find a great deal of pleasure in the performance
of your duties."</p>

<p>Miss Layton now read a few rules, saying
that she should expect them to be strictly
observed. She then told the scholars to
take out their Testaments to read, but not
expecting to have any call for them, they
had not brought them; and finding that to
be the case, she read a few verses herself,
sung a hymn, and then requested the children
to rise and stand a few moments
while she offered a short but fervent prayer<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">[47]</a></span>
for the blessing of God upon their labours.
She next proceeded to class them, and give
them their lessons for the day. Everything
that the teacher did, was done quietly,
without noise or bustle, and it seemed natural
for the children to be quiet too, and
to most of them the hours of school passed
quickly and pleasantly away.</p>

<p>"Don't you like her, Mary?" said Ella
to Mary Young, as they walked home together
that afternoon.</p>

<p>"Very much so far, Ellie, but people don't
always show what they are the first day."</p>

<p>"Well, I don't believe she'll ever be as
cross as Mr. Burton," said Ella.</p>

<p>"I hope not, I'm sure," replied Mary.</p>

<p>Ella was very anxious to secure the esteem
and friendship of her new teacher,
and for a week or two learned her lessons
so well, and observed all the rules of the
school so carefully, that it seemed as if she
had really overcome her bad habits of carelessness<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">[48]</a></span>
and inattention; but alas! it was
not so. Miss Layton required her scholars
to learn their lessons at home. They might
look them over in school, but that was all.
School hours were to be spent principally
in writing, ciphering, and reciting.</p>

<p>The first week, Ella was very careful to
learn her lessons perfectly before she went
out to play, or to work in her garden; but
one bright, warm afternoon in the latter
part of the second week, she found it so
much pleasanter out of doors, than in the
house, that she determined to take a walk
first, intending to get her lessons afterwards.
Her walk took more time than
she expected, and she found some wild flowers,
which she admired so much that she
dug them up and carried them home to
plant them in her garden, saying to herself
that it would not take long, and she would
still have time for her lessons; but she was
surprised in the midst of her employment,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">[49]</a></span>
by a call to supper, and then a play mate
came in to spend the evening and stayed
until Ella's bedtime, and as she knew it
would be worse than useless to attempt to
persuade aunt Prudence to allow her to
sit up any longer, she went to bed, with the
determination to rise early and learn her
lessons in the morning. But when morning
came, she found her bed so comfortable
that she slept on until she had barely time
to dress for breakfast; then after breakfast
her aunt sent her on an errand, and it was
school time before she could look at her
books.</p>

<p>Ella was very much alarmed, for Miss
Layton required very perfect recitations,
and expected her scholars to be very punctual
in their attendance. She hurried off
to school, got there barely in time, and then
discovered that she had left her spelling
book and geography at home. Then her
slate pencil was missing. She was sure she<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">[50]</a></span>
had either put it in her pocket, or laid it in
the corner of the desk, the night before,
but in vain she lifted everything in the desk
and turned her pocket inside out. The
missing pencil was nowhere to be found.</p>

<p>The spelling class was called. Ella
missed the first word that came to her, then
the second. "Ella," said Miss Layton,
"how many times did you go over your
lesson?"</p>

<p>Ella hung her head and made no answer.</p>

<p>Miss Layton repeated her question.</p>

<p>"I didn't learn it at all," replied Ella,
in a low voice.</p>

<p>"Then go to your seat," said her teacher,
"and never come to me to recite a lesson
that has not been learned, and remember
that at the next recitation you take your
place at the foot of the class."</p>

<p>Ella obeyed, feeling very much ashamed.
The geography class was called next, but,
remembering what had been told her, she
sat still in her seat.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">[51]</a></span></p>

<p>"Ella," said Miss Layton, "why do
you not come to your class?" "I haven't
learned the lesson, Miss Layton," said Ella.</p>

<p>Miss Layton said nothing further at the
time, but looked very much displeased. It
was now the hour for ciphering; all the
other girls took out their slates and pencils,
and were soon busily engaged. Ella alone
sat idle. Mary Young handed her a pencil,
but just then Miss Layton came up and
asked, "Why are you not at work, Ella?"</p>

<p>"I've lost my slate pencil, ma'am."</p>

<p>"She can take this one of mine," said
Mary Young; "I've got two."</p>

<p>"No," said Miss Layton, "that is against
the rules; I allow no borrowing nor lending.
As Ella has been so careless as to
lose her pencil, she must sit idle while the
rest are at work, and Ella, you must remain
in after school, and tell me how it happens
that you have so strangely failed in your
lessons to-day."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">[52]</a></span></p>

<p>Ella burst into tears. She felt very
much ashamed, and very uncomfortable
sitting there doing nothing while all the
rest were busily employed. Sallie Barnes,
who had borne a great dislike to Ella, ever
since the affair of the broken inkstand,
when she came so near being punished for
her fault, was sitting opposite, and presently
when Miss Layton was not looking
that way, she began pointing her fingers
at Ella, and shaming her. Ella was crying
and Sallie mimicked her. Ella began
to grow very angry. Sallie continued her
teasing until at last, in a transport of rage,
Ella picked up a book and dashed it across
at her tormentor. She missed her aim and
the book fell on the floor. Miss Layton
saw it fall, but did not see who threw it.</p>

<p>Rising from her seat, she crossed the
room, and asked, "Who threw that book?"</p>

<p>"Ella Clinton," said Sallie Barnes; "she
threw it at me."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">[53]</a></span></p>

<p>"Did you, Ella?"</p>

<p>"Yes, ma'am; and I'll throw another at
her, if she doesn't quit pointing at me and
mocking me," said Ella, passionately.</p>

<p>"Ella," said her teacher, sternly, "you
are showing a very wicked temper. Go
and sit down on that bench near my desk;
and you, Sallie, tell me what you were
doing to her."</p>

<p>"I didn't do anything," replied Sallie.</p>

<p>"Take care, Sallie; are you sure you
are speaking the exact truth?" said Miss
Layton.</p>

<p>"I didn't touch her, nor say a word to
her," said Sallie.</p>

<p>"Sallie, answer me immediately and
properly. You certainly did do something
to Ella; what was it?"</p>

<p>"I was only shaming her a little, because
she sat there crying just like a great baby."</p>

<p>"You did very wrong, indeed," said Miss
Layton.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">[54]</a></span></p>

<p>"I'm sure I didn't hurt her," said Sallie,
sullenly.</p>

<p>"Yes, you did, Sallie," replied her
teacher, "you hurt her feelings: and that
is often harder to bear than bodily pain. I
shall punish you by making you stand out
on the floor fifteen minutes."</p>

<p>School had seldom seemed so long to
Ella, and yet she was almost sorry to hear
Miss Layton say, "School is dismissed;"
so much did she dread being left alone with
her justly offended teacher. Miss Layton
sat at her desk, reading, until the other
scholars had all gone, and she was left alone
with Ella; then, closing her book, she
called the little girl to her.</p>

<p>"Ella," said she, taking her hand and
drawing her close to her side, "you have
had very good lessons, and behaved very
well all the time that I have been your
teacher, until to-day. Now, tell me, my
child, how it happens that to-day you have
behaved so badly, and recited so poorly."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">[55]</a></span></p>

<p>Miss Layton spoke very kindly, and Ella
felt encouraged to open her heart to her,
and tell her the whole truth; how she had
put off learning her lessons, first for one
thing, then for another, until there was no
time to do it, and then, in her haste to get
to school in season, had forgotten her
books.</p>

<p>"I am glad, Ella," said Miss Layton,
when the child had finished her story, "that
you have told me the truth, instead of trying
to contrive false excuses. I can forgive
anything sooner than falsehood, for that is
so very wicked. But you have been guilty
of several very serious faults, Ella. Your
first wrong step was preferring pleasure to
duty. There is an old saying which I
think is very true, 'Procrastination is the
thief of time.'"</p>

<p>"What does procrastination mean, Miss
Layton?" asked Ella, "I don't think I
know exactly."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">[56]</a></span></p>

<p>"It means deferring, delaying, or putting
off until another time what ought to be
done now. When we have a duty to perform,
we should always attend to that first,
and take our pleasure afterwards. But
your worst fault to-day, Ella, was getting
into such a dreadful passion. Don't you
know, my dear child, that the Bible tells
us that, when we indulge in angry passions,
we break the sixth commandment, which
says, 'Thou shalt not kill?'"</p>

<p>"Yes, ma'am, I know that; my mother
used to tell me so, and I often think I never
will get angry again, but I can't help it,
when anybody teases me."</p>

<p>"No, Ella, if you trust in your own
strength, you certainly cannot; but, my
dear child, if you ask help of God, he will
enable you to do it. I am afraid that you
forgot to ask God this morning, to keep
you from sin through the day, and if so, it
is no wonder that you have behaved so
wickedly."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">[57]</a></span></p>

<p>"I did say my prayers this morning,
Miss Layton," said Ella; "mamma told
me I must always do it, and I always do."</p>

<p>"Ah, but, my child, did you really pray?
did you think of the meaning of the words
you were saying, and really desire what
you were asking for? did you pray with
your heart, or was it with your lips only?"</p>

<p>Ella hung her head. "I was in a hurry,"
she said in a low tone, "and said them
very fast, for fear I wouldn't be ready for
breakfast."</p>

<p>"Oh Ella, were you not afraid to approach
the great God in that irreverent
manner?" said Miss Layton. "Did you
forget that, 'God is a spirit; and they that
worship him, must worship him in spirit
and in truth?' It is mocking the great
God, when you repeat a form of prayer
with your lips, while you are not praying
in your heart, and that is a dreadful sin.
The Bible tells us: 'By their fruits ye<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">[58]</a></span>
shall know them,' and you, Ella, have shown
by your actions this day, that you are a
child of wrath, even as others; that you
have a very wicked heart&mdash;a heart at enmity
with God; and, Ella, unless your
heart becomes changed, you can never be
fit to dwell with him; you would not be
happy in his presence&mdash;in the presence of
Him who is of purer eyes than to behold
sin, and cannot look upon iniquity&mdash;even
if allowed to go where he is; and every
moment that you remain as you are, you
are in danger of losing your immortal soul.
O Ella, pray earnestly to God, to give you
a new heart, for he alone can do it."</p>

<p>Ella was crying very bitterly. "O Miss
Layton," said she, "will you ask God to
forgive me, and to give me a new heart,
and help me to pray right?"</p>

<p>"I will, my dear child," replied her
teacher, and kneeling down, with her arm
around the weeping child, she offered a short<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">[59]</a></span>
but earnest prayer, asking her heavenly
Father to forgive the sins of that day and
of all their lives, asking him to give the
child a new heart&mdash;a heart hating sin and
loving holiness, and to teach her to love
prayer, and to pray aright.</p>

<p class="center" style="margin-top: 1em; margin-bottom: 1em;">"O, Miss Layton! You are more like my mamma, than anybody

<hr class="chap" />

<p>They rose from their knees, and Ella,
throwing her arms around her teacher's
neck, exclaimed, "O Miss Layton, you are
more like my mamma than anybody else;
nobody has ever prayed for me since she
died, and I have so wanted somebody to
help me to be good. You will help me now,
won't you, dear Miss Layton?"</p>

<p>"I will do all I can, Ella," replied her
teacher, returning the embrace, "but, my
dear child, no one but God can really help
you to be good. Promise me that you will
every day ask him to help you."</p>

<p>"I will," said Ella, "and I will try to
pray with my heart. But, Miss Layton,
aunt Prudence says it is no use for such a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">[60]</a></span>
wicked child as I am to pray; she says
God won't hear me, and I would have
stopped, but I remembered mother told me
always to pray, and I thought she knew
best."</p>

<p>"Your mother was right, Ella," said
Miss Layton, "for unless you pray, you
will certainly never grow any better. Jesus
said, 'I came not to call the righteous, but
sinners to repentance.' But come, my
dear, it is getting late; you may put on
your bonnet now, and get your books together,
and we will go home."</p>

<p>"I'm glad you go my way, Miss Layton,
so I don't have to go alone," said Ella.</p>

<p>"Don't you like to walk alone, Ella?"</p>

<p>"No, ma'am, I always want somebody
to talk to."</p>

<p>Miss Layton locked the school-house door,
and taking Ella's hand they walked slowly
homewards.</p>

<p>"How long is it since your mother died,
Ella?" asked Miss Layton.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">[61]</a></span></p>

<p>"A whole year, Miss Layton. Oh it
seems such a long, long while, and I do
want to see her so much!"</p>

<p>"Your mother must have been a very
good woman, I think, Ella."</p>

<p>"O yes, Miss Layton, she was so, <i>very</i>
good! I never saw her do any thing wrong;
but when I used to tell her so sometimes,
she always said, no, she was not good, she
was a miserable sinner."</p>

<p>"And she was quite right, Ella, for the
best of mortals are in the sight of God but
vile, polluted sinners. The Bible tells us
'they have all gone out of the way; there
is none that doeth good, no not one.' But
I trust your mother was a true Christian:
one who loved God, and tried to serve him.
She seems to have taken a great deal of
pains with you, and I hope you remember
her instructions. I hope you are a good
girl at home, Ella."</p>

<p>Ella was wiping away her tears. She<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">[62]</a></span>
never could talk much of her mother without
crying. "No, Miss Layton," said she,
"aunt Prudence says I am the worst child
she ever saw, and I know I'm very naughty;
but it's no use to try to be good, for I can't
do it. I used to be good when my mother
was living, but I can't be good without her
to help me."</p>

<p>"Ah, Ella, that is quite a mistake.
Your mother could not make you good, if
she were here, for she could have no power
to change your heart, and make you hate
the evil, and love the good. God alone can
do that, and though your mother has been
taken away from you, he is ever living,
and ever present, and if you ask him for
help&mdash;ask with your heart, and for Jesus'
sake&mdash;he will hear and help you."</p>

<p>"But, Miss Layton, I <i>was</i> a pretty good
girl when my mother was alive; even aunt
Prudence says so."</p>

<p>"That may be so, but I think it was only<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">[63]</a></span>
because you had not so many temptations
to do wrong. Your mother probably knew
better how to manage you, and keep you
out of the way of temptation, than your
aunt does; but you had the same wicked
heart then that you have now, and if you
behaved well only because you had no
temptation to do otherwise, you were not
<i>really</i> any better than you are now. God
looks not merely at the outward conduct,
but at the <i>heart</i>, at the <i>motives</i>, and unless
you do right from a desire to serve and
honour him, he can see nothing good in you.
Ask him, my dear child, to give you right
feelings, and right motives, and to help you
to perform every duty from an earnest desire
to please him."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">[64]</a></span></p>




<h2>CHAPTER III.</h2>


<p>"<span class="smcap">You</span> are waiting for me, are you,
Ellie?" said Miss Layton, as she locked the
school-room door, and turning to go, saw
the little girl standing near, while her
young companions were nearly all already
out of sight.</p>

<p>"Yes, ma'am," replied Ella; "I would
rather walk with you, if you will let me."</p>

<p>"Certainly, my dear child; I am always
pleased to have your company. You have
done well to-day, my dear little girl; your
lessons were well recited, and your behaviour
has been all that I could wish; and
indeed, I might say almost as much of all
the days since your bad day, which was
nearly three weeks ago. I am very glad
to be able to praise you."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">[65]</a></span></p>

<p>Ella coloured with delight. "I have remembered
what you said, Miss Layton,"
said she, "and as soon as I get home, I
always take my books, and go away up
stairs, where I can be quite alone, and study
hard, until I am sure that I know my lessons
perfectly, and it doesn't take nearly
so long as I thought it would, and I have
plenty of time to play afterwards. And I
do think it is the best plan, Miss Layton;
for sometimes we have company come in,
in the evenings, and then I'm always so
glad that my lessons are all done and out
of the way."</p>

<p>"Yes, my dear, you will find, all through
life, that it always is best to attend immediately
to any duty you have to perform;
you will never have cause to regret it.
Duty first and pleasure after, is a very good
motto for both children and grown up
people."</p>

<p>"And I remember what you said about<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">[66]</a></span>
praying with my heart," said Ella, "and
when I kneel down to say my prayers, I
say the words slowly, and try to think of
the meaning, and to really want what I
ask for; and so I find it easy to be good,
and now I think I have found out how, and
that I shall be good always."</p>

<p>"Ah, my child," replied her teacher,
"beware of self confidence. The Bible
says, 'Let him that thinketh he standeth,
take heed lest he fall.' I don't like to hear
you talk of it being <i>easy</i> to be good, for I
fear if you think it so easy, you will trust
in your own strength, and forget to ask
help of God, and then you will be <i>sure</i> to
fall. Remember how sure Peter was, that
he would never deny his Master, and yet
how soon he committed that very sin.</p>

<p>"When we begin to trust in our own
strength, God often leaves us to ourselves,
and suffers us to fall, that we may learn
that our own strength is perfect weakness.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">[67]</a></span>
The Bible tells us that 'the heart is deceitful
above all things, and desperately
wicked,' and so true is this of the unrenewed
heart, that we find it has naturally no love
for what is good and holy, but, on the contrary,
a constant inclination to that which
is evil; so much so, that we cannot of ourselves
resist any temptation to sin, or even
so much as think a good thought; we are
prone to do evil, and averse to what is
good; our goodness is as the morning
cloud and the early dew which vanisheth
away. Our only safety, Ella, is in remembering
our own weakness, and crying with
David, 'Hold thou me up, and I shall be
safe.' You know Paul says, 'When I am
weak, then am I strong,' no doubt meaning,
when I feel my own weakness and look to
God for strength, he strengthens me."</p>

<p>"Miss Layton," said Ella, "it is a great
deal easier to be good at school than at
home; for you praise me when I am good,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">[68]</a></span>
and seem pleased to see me trying to do
right, but aunt Prudence never does. She
says people don't deserve to be praised for
doing their duty, and no matter how hard
I try to please her, she always finds something
to scold me for."</p>

<p>"I think your aunt is partly right and
partly wrong," said Miss Layton. "It
certainly is true, in one sense, that people
don't deserve praise for doing only what it
is their duty to do, but none of us would
have many blessings if we received only
what we deserve, and I think it is right and
best to give praise because it encourages
people in trying to do well. But, Ella,
though it is quite right that you should desire
to please your aunt, and your undoubted
duty to do so, for she stands to you in the
place of your parents, whom God has commanded
you to honour, yet your highest
motive should ever be to please God; and,
though your aunt may not notice your efforts,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">[69]</a></span>
you may rest assured that not one of
your struggles to conquer your temper, or
overcome your habits of carelessness and
indolence, remains unnoticed by him."</p>

<p>"Well, Miss Layton, I haven't been in a
real passion for more than two weeks, and
I'm nearly sure I never will get into such
a fit of rage, as aunt Prudence calls it,
again."</p>

<p>"Ah, Ella, don't be too confident," replied
her teacher.</p>

<p>"Oh I'm <i>sure</i> I won't, Miss Layton. I
can't help getting a <i>little</i> angry sometimes,
but I'm certain almost that I never will get
so <i>dreadfully</i> angry as I used to, for I
know it is so ugly, and so wicked."</p>

<p>Miss Layton shook her head doubtingly.
"Time will show, Ella. Bad habits are
not so easily got rid of. But good bye,
child," she added, stooping and kissing the
little girl's cheek, "you know you have to
turn off here."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">[70]</a></span></p>

<p>"Good bye, Miss Layton," said Ella,  "I
mean to have real good lessons to-morrow."</p>

<p>"Oh, Ella, how pretty your flowers are!
won't you give me one?" exclaimed a little
girl who overtook Ella just as she was passing
down the lane which bounded that part
of her aunt's grounds where her own little
garden was situated. Ella was naturally
a very generous child.</p>

<p>"Yes, a good many more than one,
Lucy," said she, "if you will wait till I
can get round to them, for you know the
gate is round on the other side."</p>

<p>"Oh, I'm in a dreadful hurry, Ellie," replied
Lucy, "Mother told me not to stop a
minute, and I'm all out of breath with running.
Can't you climb the fence?"</p>

<p>"Well, if you're in such a <i>very</i> great
hurry I suppose I must for once, though
aunt Prudence wouldn't like it very much;
but then she always scolds me, and I guess
she might about as well scold for one thing<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">[71]</a></span>
as another," said Ella, and as she spoke,
she threw her satchel of books over, and
then climbed the fence. In a moment she
was on the other side, and had gathered a
handful of flowers and reached them through
the fence to Lucy, who still stood on the
outside. Lucy ran on, and Ella picked up
her satchel and walked into the house.</p>

<p>Now it happened that Miss Prudence
was in an unusually bad humour. Everything
had seemed to go wrong with her
that day. A neighbour's boy had left the
garden gate open, and before it was noticed
some pigs had got in and destroyed a great
many of her choicest vegetables and flowers,
and while she and Sallie, her maid,
were engaged in chasing them out, the
cakes in the oven had nearly burnt to a cinder;
and, to crown all, Sallie, flurried by
the scolding of her mistress, had let fall
and broken a much valued dish of old-fashioned
china. In consequence of these<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">[72]</a></span>
various mishaps Miss Prudence was in one
of her very <i>worst</i> humours, which is saying
a good deal, as she was not at any time
remarkably sweet-tempered.</p>

<p>"Your dress torn again, miss!" she exclaimed,
the instant she caught sight of her
niece. "You've been climbing fences again,
hey?"</p>

<p>"I didn't know it was torn," said Ella,
looking down. "Where, aunt Prudence? I
don't see it."</p>

<p>"There! what do you call that?" said
Miss Prudence, fiercely, taking hold of the
skirt of Ella's dress, and showing a small
slit torn in one of the breadths.</p>

<p>"Oh, that is only a <i>little</i> hole, aunt
Prudence," said Ella.</p>

<p>"A <i>little</i> hole? Yes, but I'd like to know
if you aren't <i>always</i> tearing your clothes,
and if you'd torn it all the way round, it
would have been all the same to you."</p>

<p>Ella's temper was rising, more from the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">[73]</a></span>
tone than the words her aunt had used,
"I ain't <i>always</i> tearing my clothes," said
she, angrily, "you <i>know</i> I haven't torn one
for a good while, and it's ever so long since
I climbed a fence till to-day."</p>

<p>"How dare you contradict me, you impertinent
little hussy!" said aunt Prudence,
catching hold of her and shaking her violently,
and boxing her ears, then pushing
her from her with such violence as to
throw her down.</p>

<p>"You're just the crossest woman in the
world," exclaimed Ella,&mdash;now thoroughly
roused as soon as she recovered her breath
sufficiently to speak, "I don't care if I <i>do</i>
tear my clothes! I don't care if I tear
them all to pieces, and I shan't try to please
you any more, for you're just as cross as
you can be; you're always scolding me,
and never praise me a bit when I try just
as hard as I can to please you."</p>

<p>"Just walk right up stairs, and don't let<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">[74]</a></span>
me hear another word out of your mouth,
or see your face again to-day," said aunt
Prudence; "if I served you right I'd give
you a good switching, and may be I'll do
it yet; but just walk straight up stairs,
and stay there; for not a mouthful of supper
shall you have to-night."</p>

<p>"I won't!" said Ella, "I ain't going
to be shut up in that hot room all the afternoon.
I'll stay out of doors," and she ran
out as she spoke.</p>

<p>"We'll soon see that," said aunt Prudence,
"we'll soon see who's mistress,"
catching her by the arm and dragging her
into the house. Ella resisted with all the
strength of passion; but in vain; her
aunt proved the stronger, and after a desperate
battle succeeded in forcing her up
stairs and into her own room, where she shut
her in, and locked the door upon her, and
then, putting the key in her pocket, walked
down stairs; while Ella, mad with rage, assailed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">[75]</a></span>
the door with a shower of kicks and
blows, in the vain attempt to regain her
liberty, at the same time screaming at the
top of her voice.</p>

<p>At length, completely exhausted by her
own violence, she desisted, and sitting down
on the floor, she laid her head on a chair,
and cried herself to sleep.</p>

<p>When Ella waked, the moon was shining
in at the window, everything about the
house was perfectly still, and feeling
frightened at the silence, and chilly from
the night wind, which had been blowing
on her, she crept into bed without undressing,
and soon fell asleep again.</p>

<p>It was long past her usual rising hour,
when she waked again with a confused
feeling that something was wrong. She
lay quiet a moment, trying to collect her
thoughts. Suddenly, she remembered her
lessons; she had not looked at them. Instantly
springing from the bed, she hastily<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">[76]</a></span>
washed her face, combed her hair, and
smoothed her rumpled dress as well as she
could, and then tried the door. It was fast;
she was still a prisoner, and her satchel of
books had been left in the hall below.
What should she do? she tried the door
again and again; she called aunt Prudence
as loud as she could, but there was no answer,
and sitting down on the floor, she
cried bitterly.</p>

<p>In about half an hour, aunt Prudence
came, and unlocking the door, ordered her
niece to walk down stairs and eat her
breakfast, which command Ella very gladly
obeyed, as she was very hungry; but,
troubled about her lessons, she hurried
through her meal as fast as possible, and
as soon as she had finished, requested permission
of her aunt to leave the table, and
get her books.</p>

<p>"No," replied Miss Prudence, sharply,
"how often must I tell that it is very bad<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">[77]</a></span>
manners to leave the table until every one
has finished? Just sit still and behave
yourself; you'll not gain anything from
me by that vulgar habit you have of eating
so fast."</p>

<p>It was almost more than Ella could bear,
to have to sit there and watch her aunt,
who seemed to eat more slowly than she
had ever known her to do before, when she
knew that she had scarcely time to learn
her lessons before the hour for school. At
last, aunt Prudence pushed back her chair,
and rose from the table; Ella rose too, and
hurried into the hall to get her books.</p>

<p>"Come back here!" called out aunt Prudence.
"What are you going to do?"</p>

<p>"I was just going to get my books, to
learn my lessons."</p>

<p>"You'll do no such thing, till you've
mended that dress. Get your thimble, and
sit down here alongside of me, and darn it.
If you will tear your clothes, I'm determined<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">[78]</a></span>
you shall mend them; and mind and
do it well, or I'll make you pick every stitch
of it out, and do it over."</p>

<p>Poor Ella was in despair. "O aunt Prudence,"
said she, bursting into tears, "I
won't know my lessons, and Miss Layton
will be so angry. Mayn't I learn them
now, and mend my dress when I come home
from school? Oh, do <i>please</i> let me."</p>

<p>"No; I tell you, you shall mend it <i>just
now</i>. I don't care if Miss Layton <i>is</i> angry.
I only hope she'll give you a right good
whipping, for if you had behaved yourself
last night, you might have had plenty of
time to learn your lessons."</p>

<p>Ella wiped away her tears, and commenced
her work, for she knew that crying
was of no use, and would only hinder her
from doing her work quickly and well. She
took a great deal of pains, and was very
careful not to make a single long stitch,
and at last it was done, and very nicely<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">[79]</a></span>
too, she thought, but when she showed it
to her aunt, she was told that it was puckered
a little, and must all come out again.</p>

<p>"I can't do it a bit better, and I won't,"
said Ella, throwing the dress on the floor.</p>

<p>"You shall," said her aunt. "Pick up
that dress this minute, and do as I bid
you."</p>

<p>Ella neither moved to obey, nor answered
a word.</p>

<p>"Sallie," called out Miss Prudence to
the servant girl, who was in the next room
washing up the breakfast dishes, "bring
me a switch, till I make this child mind
me."</p>

<p>"Yes, ma'am," replied Sallie; and the
next minute she appeared at the door with
a switch, which she had just cut from the
willow tree in the yard.</p>

<p>"Pick up that dress," said Miss Prudence
again, flourishing the switch. Ella
stood still, mute and obstinate. Aunt Prudence<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">[80]</a></span>
seized her by the arm, and laid the
switch over her shoulders with all her
strength. Ella bore it without a word.</p>

<p>"Now, will you mind me?" again inquired
her aunt, pausing for breath.</p>

<p>"No!" said Ella.</p>

<p>"You'll not go one step to school till
you do," said her aunt.</p>

<p>"I don't care; I don't want to go, when
I don't know my lessons."</p>

<p>"Then you <i>shall</i> go! Just take your
bonnet, and start this minute. I'll make
you do something I bid you," said her
aunt.</p>

<p>Ella obeyed, only too glad to get rid of
doing her work over again; though she had
spoken truly in saying that she did not care
to go to school without knowing her lessons.</p>

<p>"The most high-tempered, obstinate
child that ever breathed," said aunt Prudence,
turning away from the window,
where she had been standing to watch Ella
out of the gate.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">[81]</a></span></p>

<p>"Now," said Ella, talking to herself, as
she had a habit of doing, as she walked
slowly along:  "I can't get to school in
time, and I'll be sure to get a bad mark
for attendance anyhow, so I may just as
well walk a little slower, and get my spelling
lesson as I go along."</p>

<p>Ella had a very retentive memory, and
was quite a good speller for a child of her
age, and as the lesson happened to be an
easy one, she had learned it quite perfectly
by the time she had reached the school-house
door. The opening exercises were
quite over when Ella entered the room.
Miss Layton looked up as she came in, and
motioned to her to come to her.</p>

<p>"How has it happened that you are so
late this morning, my child?" said she.</p>

<p>"I couldn't help it, Miss Layton; aunt
Prudence made me stay to mend my dress."</p>

<p>"That is a sufficient excuse," replied her
teacher, "I am very glad, Ella, that I can
always believe what you say."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">[82]</a></span></p>

<p>"I couldn't have got here quite in time,
Miss Layton," said Ella, "but I might
have come a little sooner if I hadn't walked
slowly, so as to learn my spelling lesson on
the way."</p>

<p>Miss Layton looked surprised, but made
no remark, as it was now time to call a
class. Ella recited her spelling lesson perfectly,
but made several mistakes in her
geography, which would indeed have been
a total failure, as she had not looked at her
lesson, if it had not been the day for reviewing
that study, so that the lesson was
one which she had learned only a short
time before, and had not entirely forgotten.
Grammar was the lesson she dreaded most,
as she had only lately commenced the
study, and often found it difficult to understand
and commit it to memory. But that
was not to be recited until after recess, and
she determined to spend her playtime in
studying it.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">[83]</a></span></p>

<p>Accordingly when the bell tapped for recess,
she took her book in her hand and
slipped away to a corner of the play-ground
where, concealed by some bushes, she
thought she might remain unnoticed by her
companions. But Ella was a favourite
with most of her school-fellows, and it was
not long ere she was missed, and "Where's
Ella?" "Where's Ella?" "Didn't she come
out?" "Do you know where she went to?"
were the questions which passed from mouth
to mouth amongst a group of girls who
were preparing to commence a game of
romps.</p>

<p>"What's the matter? what are you all
talking about?" asked Sallie Barnes, coming
up to them.</p>

<p>"We're going to play 'Chickeny-crany-crow,'
and we want Ella to be the old witch,
but we can't find her; do you know where
she is?"</p>

<p>"Yes," said Sallie, "I saw her go behind<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">[84]</a></span>
those bushes. Come along girls, and
let's see what she's about. Some mischief,
I'll be bound."</p>

<p>Half a dozen girls started at once on a
full run across the play-ground to the spot
pointed out by Sallie.</p>

<p>"Why, Ellie, what <i>are</i> you doing here?
why don't you come and play?" exclaimed
Kate Townley pushing aside the bushes.
"We want you this minute."</p>

<p>"I'm learning my grammar," replied
Ella, without looking up from her book,
"so don't talk to me, please, for I'm in a
great hurry, because it comes right away
after recess, you know."</p>

<p>"Getting your lesson! getting it <i>now</i>,
when it's almost time to say it! I wonder
if this is the pattern good girl, that always
learns her lessons just as soon as she gets
home, and never allows herself a bit of
play till she knows them perfectly!" said
Sallie, in a mocking tone.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">[85]</a></span></p>

<p>"I do <i>almost</i> always, Sallie, but I didn't
last night, and so please go away, and let
me learn it now."</p>

<p>"Oh ho, now I remember this pattern
girl missed quite a number of questions in
her geography, and if it had been that
naughty girl Sallie Barnes, she would have
been kept in. Ah, it's a fine thing to be a
favourite, a very nice thing to be the teacher's
pet!"</p>

<p>"It's no such thing," said Ella, angrily,
"you know very well that Miss Layton
doesn't pet me; she treats us all alike."</p>

<p>"You're right, Ellie, so she does, at least
according to the way we behave," said
Mary Young.</p>

<p>"What a shame of you to talk so, Sallie!
you know Ellie didn't miss more than two,
and Miss Layton doesn't keep us in for that
much," said Kate.</p>

<p>"Well <i>I</i> say she missed three or four,"
said Sallie, "and I'll be bound she'll miss<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">[86]</a></span>
more than that in the grammar, for I happen
to know that it's pretty hard, and she'll
be kept after school for that; and then I
hope Miss Layton will give her as good a
whipping as she did once before."</p>

<p>"She didn't; she never struck me in her
life," said Ella.</p>

<p>"I know better; she did," said Sallie.</p>

<p>"That's a lie, and you know it is," said
Ella, growing very angry.</p>

<p>"So I suppose you'll go and tell <i>dear</i>
Miss Layton, that Sallie Barnes has been
telling lies about you."</p>

<p>"No, I'll <i>not</i>," said Ella. "You know
I won't, or you wouldn't dare to talk so. I
don't tell lies nor tales either; I would
not stoop to do anything so mean and
wicked."</p>

<p>"So you mean to say I'm mean and
wicked, a liar and a tell-tale! Never mind,
miss, I'll pay you for your impudence, one
of these days."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">[87]</a></span></p>

<p>"I don't think your stories hang together
very well, Sallie," said Mary Young.
"First you say Miss Layton pets Ella, and
then you say she whipped her for what I
know she wouldn't whip any other scholar
for."</p>

<p>Sallie was saved the necessity of replying,
for at that instant the bell rang, and
all hastened to the house.</p>

<p>"You have all recited very well excepting
Ella," said Miss Layton, as she dismissed
the grammar class to their seats.
"Ella, you must learn this lesson over and
recite it to me after school is dismissed."</p>

<p>"Ah, ha! I told you so!" whispered
Sallie in Ella's ear.</p>

<p>Ella answered only with an angry look&mdash;it
was against the rules to speak, but Sallie
did not care for that, for though she would
have been very ready to tell of Ella, she
knew that Ella was much too honourable to
tell tales of her. As soon as the others<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">[88]</a></span>
had all gone, Ella took her book to Miss
Layton, and this time she recited her lesson
quite perfectly.</p>

<p>"You know it very well, now," said her
teacher, handing the book back to her.
"What is it, my dear?" she asked, seeing
the child hesitate. "Had you something
to say to me? Don't be afraid to tell me
all that is in your heart. If you are in
trouble, perhaps I can help you, and if you
have done wrong, I will not judge you
harshly," she added, drawing the little girl
towards her.</p>

<p>Ella threw her arms round her teacher's
neck, and hiding her face on her shoulder,
burst into tears. Miss Layton stroked her
hair, and talked soothingly to her. Her
heart yearned over the little motherless
child, who had no one to love her.</p>

<p>"O Miss Layton, I can never, never be
good. It's no use to try," sobbed the poor
child.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">[89]</a></span></p>

<p>"What new difficulty have you found,
my darling? you told me it was very easy
last night."</p>

<p>"I'm afraid you will hate me, Miss Layton,
if I tell you how wicked I have been
last night and this morning."</p>

<p>"Hate you, my child! far from it. I
will love you the better for acknowledging
your faults. Tell me all about it, and perhaps
I may be able to help you to do
better."</p>

<p>Ella related all the occurrences of that
morning and the previous evening, without
attempting any palliation of her own conduct.</p>

<p>"I am very sorry, indeed, to hear all
this, Ella," said Miss Layton. "You have
really been very naughty. In the first
place, you ought not to have climbed the
fence; that was very wrong, because you
knew that your aunt had forbidden it."</p>

<p>"But Lucy wanted the flowers, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">[90]</a></span>
couldn't wait for me to go round to the gate.
What could I do, Miss Layton?"</p>

<p>"It would have been much better to let
Lucy go without the flowers than to disobey
your aunt."</p>

<p>"But, Miss Layton, she <i>always</i> scolds
me! I can <i>never</i> please her, and I don't
mean to try any more."</p>

<p>"O Ella, Ella! is this the end of all
your good resolutions? Who is it that says,
'Honour thy father and thy mother?'"</p>

<p>"But aunt Prudence isn't my mother,"
said Ella.</p>

<p>"No, my dear, but she occupies the
place of a parent to you, and the spirit of
the command requires you to obey her."</p>

<p>"I can't please her, Miss Layton. I've
tried and tried and tried, and what's the
use of trying any more?"</p>

<p>"Ah, Ella, if you had a new heart, if
you were a child of God, you would try to
do right that you might please <i>him</i>; and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">[91]</a></span>
you would not give up in despair, though
no one else noticed your efforts, or looked
upon you with approval. I am afraid, my
child, that you love praise too well; that
you 'love the praise of men more than the
praise of God.'"</p>

<p>"I don't <i>like</i> to mind aunt Prudence! I
wish I <i>didn't</i> have to!"</p>

<p>"'This is the love of God, that we keep
his commandments, and his commandments
are not grievous.' There is the test, Ella;
by your fruits you are to be known. God
commands you to honour and obey your
aunt, and if that command is grievous to
you, does it not show that you are not one
of his children?"</p>

<p>"I know I'm not, Miss Layton," said
Ella, sadly. "I'm afraid I <i>never</i> shall be
a Christian, for I'm so very, very wicked,
and I can't make myself any better, for I've
tried so hard, and I only seem to grow more
and more wicked, the more I try to be
good."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">[92]</a></span></p>

<p>"I am glad to hear you say so, Ella. I
had much rather hear you talk in that way,
than as you did last night, because I know
that a sense of your own helplessness, of
your own utter inability to make yourself
any better, is the first step towards feeling
your need of the Saviour; for as long as
you think that there is any hope that you
can heal yourself, you will not apply to the
Great Physician. 'Come unto me all ye
that labour and are heavy laden, and I will
give you rest. Take my yoke upon you,
and learn of me, for I am meek and lowly
in heart, and ye shall find rest unto your
souls; for my yoke is easy, and my burden
is light!' That invitation is addressed to
you, Ella, if you do, as I hope, feel your
sins to be a burden."</p>

<p>"I'm afraid it doesn't mean me, Miss
Layton, for I'm afraid I don't <i>want</i> to be
good. I feel just like giving it up and not
trying any more."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93">[93]</a></span></p>

<p>"Then, Ella, pray to God to <i>give</i> you
the desire; to make you want to be good.
Jesus said, 'Blessed are they which do
hunger and thirst after righteousness, for
they shall be filled.'"</p>

<p>"Won't you pray for me, Miss Layton?"</p>

<p>"I do, dear child, and will," said Miss
Layton, kissing her; "but you must pray
for yourself; I cannot do the work for you&mdash;no
one can; you must pray and repent
and believe for yourself."</p>

<p>"O Miss Layton, I wish I could live with
you!" exclaimed Ella, "for then I think
I could be good."</p>

<p>Miss Layton smiled. "I am coming to
live at your house, my dear; didn't you
know it? didn't your aunt tell you?"</p>

<p>"Oh no, ma'am; but are you, <i>really</i>?
Oh, I am so glad, <i>so</i> glad!" and Ella
clapped her hands, and fairly danced up
and down with delight.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">[94]</a></span></p>

<p>"Yes; Mrs. Price is tired of boarding
me, and your aunt has agreed to take me
for the rest of the time that I shall be here."</p>

<p>"And when will you come, Miss Layton?
Oh, do come soon!"</p>

<p>"To-morrow evening, my dear; but,
Ella, I shall not like to live with you, if
you are going to be such a naughty girl as
you were last night and this morning."</p>

<p>"Oh no, indeed, I'll not; I should be
ashamed to be so bad before you."</p>

<p>"And do you feel more respect for <i>me</i>&mdash;a
weak, sinful mortal&mdash;than for the great
God? more ashamed and afraid to do
wrong in my presence, than in his?"</p>

<p>"O Miss Layton, I can't see him, and I
forget that he sees me."</p>

<p>"Do you think that that excuse will avail
you in the judgment-day, Ella? The Bible
tells us, 'The wicked shall be turned into
hell, and all they that forget God.' O
Ella, when you are tempted to do wrong,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">[95]</a></span>
remember these words: 'Thou God seest
me;' and O my child, never, never dare to
do in his presence, what you would be
ashamed or afraid to do before any earthly
being."</p>

<p>"I'm very sorry I was so naughty," said
Ella, "and I'll tell aunt Prudence so, and
ask her to forgive me, and I'll do as she
bids me, and mend the dress over again if
she says I must; though I'm sure I can't
do it any better."</p>

<p>"Ask forgiveness of God too, Ella."</p>

<p>"Yes, ma'am, I will."</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>"I'm sorry I was so naughty and so impertinent
to you last night and this morning,
aunt Prudence," said Ella, coming up
to her aunt, on her return from school.
"Will you please to forgive me, and I'll
try to mind you next time."</p>

<p>"Oh yes, it's all very well to say you're
sorry now, but it'll be just the very same<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">[96]</a></span>
thing again, the very next time you're in
a bad humour."</p>

<p>"Shall I rip that darn out, and do it
over now, aunt Prudence?"</p>

<p>"No; I've had bother enough with it
already; let it alone."</p>

<hr class="chap" />

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97">[97]</a></span></p>




<h2>CHAPTER IV.</h2>


<p>"<span class="smcap">Just</span> look, Miss Layton, how Ella
Clinton has torn my book," said Sallie
Barnes, displaying her arithmetic, several
leaves of which were missing.</p>

<p>"How do you know that it was Ella that
did it?" asked Miss Layton.</p>

<p>"Why, because she hates me; and I
heard her say, the other day, that she'd
tear my books or do something to spite me,
and when I came to school this morning,
she was standing right beside my desk, and
Abby Reed says she saw her turning my
things over before I came, so I'm <i>sure</i> she
must have done it."</p>

<p>"It does look like it, certainly," said
Miss Layton, "but still I can hardly believe<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">[98]</a></span>
Ella would do such a thing. Come here,
Ella. Did you tear this? or do you know
how it came to be torn."</p>

<p>"No, ma'am," said Ella, indignantly, "I
didn't touch it, and I don't know anything
about it."</p>

<p>"Did you go to Sallie's desk, and turn
over her things, this morning before school
commenced?"</p>

<p>"I didn't turn over the things, Miss
Layton. I went to her desk, and looked
in her pencil box to see if my slate-pencil
was there, but I didn't touch anything
else."</p>

<p>"What made you think of looking for
your pencil in Sallie's box?"</p>

<p>Ella coloured, and remained silent.</p>

<p>"I want an answer, Ella," said Miss
Layton. "You must have had some reason
for supposing your pencil was there; what
was it?"</p>

<p>"I thought may-be she had hidden it;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99">[99]</a></span>
because the other day I told her something
she said was a lie, and she was very angry,
and said she would pay me for it," replied
Ella.</p>

<p>"And were your suspicions correct? did
you find your pencil there?"</p>

<p>"Yes, ma'am," said Ella.</p>

<p>"If she did, she must have put it there
first, for I never touched it," said Sallie.</p>

<p>"Hush, Sallie," said Miss Layton. "Ella,
are you sure it was <i>your</i> pencil? slate pencils
are very much alike, you may have
been mistaken."</p>

<p>"No, ma'am, I know it was mine, because
I had cut some letters on it," replied
Ella.</p>

<p>"I wish you'd look in <i>her</i> desk, Miss
Layton," said Sallie, "and see if she hasn't
got the leaves of my arithmetic hid there."</p>

<p>Miss Layton rose and went to Ella's
desk, raised the lid and examined the contents,
while the two girls stood looking on.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100">[100]</a></span>
Presently moving a pile of books, she found
several leaves, which had been tucked away
behind them, and which, on being compared
with Sallie's book, proved to be evidently
the missing portion; though one of them
had been torn in half, and, from the stains
of ink upon it, seemed to have been used
for wiping a pen. "I told you so! I knew
she'd done it!" exclaimed Sallie, exultingly;
while Ella gazed at the leaves in her teacher's
hand with an expression of unfeigned
astonishment that did not escape Miss Layton's
quick eye.</p>

<p>"And she's been using this leaf for a
pen-wiper," continued Sallie, "she's always
wanting a piece of paper to wipe her
pen, because she's so careless she can never
keep a pen-wiper."</p>

<p>"How do you account for this strong
circumstantial evidence against you, Ella?"
asked her teacher.</p>

<p>"I don't know, Miss Layton, I don't<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101">[101]</a></span>
know at <i>all</i> how they got there," said Ella,
with a bewildered look. "I've been in
the school-room ever since it was opened
this morning, and I didn't see any body
put them there."</p>

<p>"I believe you, Ella," said Miss Layton,
"for whatever other faults you may have,
I know you to be a perfectly truthful child."</p>

<p>"Oh yes, it's a fine thing to be the teacher's
<i>pet</i>!" said Sallie, tossing her head.
"You'd be ready enough to believe that <i>I</i>
had done such a thing, because you don't
like <i>me</i>."</p>

<p>"I <i>should</i> be more ready to believe it
of you, than of Ella, Sallie; because, and
<i>only</i> because, you have not established the
same character for truth. I have more
than once had great reason to doubt <i>your</i>
word, but <i>never</i> Ella's. A teacher soon
discovers whose word she can trust and
whose she cannot."</p>

<p>"It's just because she's your favourite,"
said Sallie, angrily.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102">[102]</a></span></p>

<p>"Go to your seat," said Miss Layton, "I
will not allow such impertinence, and shall
mark you for it in your weekly report.
Can any of the rest of you throw any light
upon this subject?" she inquired, turning
to the other scholars.</p>

<p>"Miss Layton," said the girl who sat
next to Sallie, "I think, perhaps Sallie
tore her book herself, for I heard her say
yesterday, that she would tear out those
leaves because she couldn't do the sums."</p>

<p>The girl who kept the key and attended
to the room, now came up, and told Miss
Layton that Sallie had come to her to borrow
the key on the previous evening, saying
that she had forgotten her books, and must
get them, or she should not know her lessons.
"Yes, and I was going after the
cows," said Charley Owen, "and I saw the
school door open, and I thought may-be
somebody was breaking in, so I ran and
looked in at the door, and I saw Sallie<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_103" id="Page_103">[103]</a></span>
sitting by Ellie's desk a writing, and she
tore a leaf out of a book, and wiped her
pen on it, and then she looked at the book
awhile, and then tore out some more leaves,
and then she raised up the lid and put the
ink in the desk, and I guess she put the
leaves in too."</p>

<p>"It's all a lie," exclaimed Sallie; "there
was nobody here when I was getting my
books."</p>

<p>"I just peeped in at the door, and then
I ran off, and she didn't see me," said
Charley.</p>

<p>"The proof of your guilt is too plain to
admit of a doubt," said Miss Layton, turning
to the now abashed and confused Sallie.
"You will of course remain with me after
the rest are dismissed."</p>

<p>"Oh, how shall I talk to that hardened
girl!" was the thought which many times
presented itself to Miss Layton's mind,
while engaged in the duties of the day; and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104">[104]</a></span>
many a silent petition for assistance went
up to Him who hath promised wisdom to
them that ask it.</p>

<p>At length the hour had arrived, school
was dismissed, and the children, always
glad to be released from study and confinement,
were not long in leaving the
teacher alone with her refractory pupil.
"Sallie," said Miss Layton, "you know
that borrowing is against the rules, how
then do you account for the fact of Ella's
pencil having been found in your box?"</p>

<p>"What's the use of my answering? you
won't believe me, if I do," said Sallie,
angrily.</p>

<p>"You must speak more respectfully,
Sallie," said Miss Layton, "or I shall feel
obliged to inform your parents of your
very bad behaviour. I wish you now to
answer my question, and tell me the truth,
the whole truth, and nothing but the truth."</p>

<p>"I don't know anything about it," replied<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_105" id="Page_105">[105]</a></span>
Sallie, "I didn't put it there, and if
Ella Clinton found it in my box, she must
have put it there herself."</p>

<p>"Well, Sallie, <i>I</i> cannot tell whether you
are speaking the truth or not, but I want
you to remember that God knows all about
it; for the Bible tells us that 'all things are
naked and open unto the eyes of him with
whom we have to do;' and the Psalmist
says, 'O Lord, thou hast searched me and
known me. Thou knowest my down sitting,
and mine uprising; thou understandest my
<i>thought</i> afar off. Thou compassest my path
and my lying down, and art acquainted
with all my ways, for there is not a word
in my tongue, but lo! O Lord, thou knowest
it altogether.' God, who is the searcher of
the heart, knows all your motives, has seen
all your actions, and heard all your words,
and in his book of remembrance all these
things are written, and for them all, he will
call you to account in the day of judgment.
Sallie, do you ever read the Bible?"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106">[106]</a></span></p>

<p>"I read it sometimes of a Sunday, when
I can't find anything I like better."</p>

<p>"I am sorry, Sallie, to hear you speak
so slightingly of God's word, which is the
Book of books and the one which we should
value above all others. But it seems you
do read it occasionally&mdash;have you ever read
the story of Ananias and Sapphira?"</p>

<p>"I don't remember," said Sallie, sulkily.</p>

<p>Miss Layton opened her Bible, and read
aloud the story of that wicked man and
woman whom God struck dead for telling
a lie. As I suppose my little readers have
all read this sad story, I shall not repeat
it here; but if they have not read it, they
will find it in the fifth chapter of Acts, and
I hope they will get their Testaments, and
read it now, and that they will take warning
by the awful punishment of Ananias
and Sapphira, and never, never <i>dare</i> to tell
a lie.</p>

<p>When Miss Layton had finished reading,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_107" id="Page_107">[107]</a></span>
she proceeded to talk to Sallie of the great
wickedness of her conduct, the dreadful sin
of lying, quoting a number of texts to show
God's hatred of that sin, such as, "Lying
lips are an abomination to the Lord," "The
lip of truth shall be established for ever;
but a lying tongue is but for a moment,"
"A false witness shall not be unpunished,
and he that speaketh lies shall perish,"
"All liars shall have their part in the lake
that burneth with fire and brimstone," and
many others.</p>

<p>"Sallie," said she, "I do not think there
is any sin which is mentioned more frequently
in the Holy Scriptures, as being
exceedingly hateful to God, than that of
lying; and we are expressly told that no
liar shall be allowed to enter the holy city,
the New Jerusalem. 'For,' says the apostle
John, 'without are dogs, and sorcerers, and
whoremongers, and murderers, and idolaters,
and whosoever <i>loveth</i> and <i>maketh</i> a lie.'<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108">[108]</a></span>
You would look with abhorrence upon a
murderer&mdash;one who had dipped his hands
in the blood of his fellow-man&mdash;and yet
you see that liars are put in the same catalogue,
as being no better than they. But
have you not really been a murderer in
<i>heart</i> this day, Sallie? Have you not felt
hatred to Ella, and a desire to do her harm?
and is not that the very spirit of murder?
'Whosoever hateth his brother is a murderer;'
and was not that the very feeling
that led Cain to kill his brother? You
have to-day broken several of God's commandments;
the sixth, which is: 'Thou
shalt not kill,' for the Bible tells us that
anger is a breach of that command; and
the ninth, which is: 'Thou shalt not bear
false witness against thy neighbour.'</p>

<p>"Sallie, I should not be doing my duty,
if I did not speak to you of the great wickedness
of which you have been guilty; if I
did not warn you of the necessity of repentance.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_109" id="Page_109">[109]</a></span>
'The soul that sinneth, it shall die,'
says God. 'He that, being often reproved,
hardeneth his neck, shall suddenly be destroyed,
and that without remedy.' 'Because
I have called, and ye refused; I have
stretched out my hand, and no man regarded;
but ye have set at nought all my
counsel, and would none of my reproof: I
also will laugh at your calamity: I will
mock when your fear cometh.' But again,
he tells us, 'I have no pleasure in the
death of him that dieth, but rather that he
turn from his evil way and live. Turn ye,
turn ye, for why will ye die, O house of
Israel!' O Sallie, can you refuse to listen
to these awful threatenings, or to accept
of these gracious invitations? Would that
I could persuade you to turn from your evil
ways <i>now</i>&mdash;now while you are young, and
while you have health and strength and
reason&mdash;for '<i>now</i> is the accepted time, and
<i>now</i> is the day of salvation,' and you can
be sure of no time but the present."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110">[110]</a></span></p>

<p>Much more Miss Layton said to Sallie,
but she went home that night with a sad
heart, for she could not perceive that her
words had made any impression.</p>

<p>When Miss Layton entered her school-room
next morning, she found her pupils in
quite a state of excitement. "O Miss
Layton, Miss Layton!" they exclaimed on
seeing her, "Sallie Barnes and her mother
have been here getting Sallie's books, and
they took them all away, and Mrs. Barnes
says, Sallie shan't come to school to you another
day, because you talked to her just
as if she was the greatest sinner in the
world, and she's just as good as other folks.
And she's not going to have her abused;
she won't let her stay where she's called a
liar and a murderer. And Mrs. Barnes
says, Sallie never told a lie in all her life,
for she knows she'd get half killed if she
did; her children are all brought up to
speak the truth; and we all know that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_111" id="Page_111">[111]</a></span>
that's not so, for nobody believes a word
that either Sallie or her mother says. Oh,
she was <i>very</i> mad, Miss Layton, and scolded
away ever so long, and swore too; and she
says she's going to give you a piece of her
mind when she sees you."</p>

<p>"I am very sorry indeed to hear that
any one would behave so wickedly," said
Miss Layton, "but if Sallie is such a very
bad girl, I am glad she is gone, for the
Bible says, 'Evil communications corrupt
good manners,' and I fear she might have
made some of the rest of you as bad as herself.
But if Sallie has such a wicked
mother, there is great allowance to be made
for her, poor girl! and you should feel very
thankful that you have been blest with
good mothers, who, instead of encouraging
you in wickedness, try to teach you to do
right."</p>

<h2>CHAPTER V.</h2>


<p>"<span class="smcap">If</span> you'll excuse me, Miss Layton, I'll
just leave Ella to entertain you, as I have
an errand out, but I'll not be gone long,"
said Miss Prudence Clinton, one evening,
soon after Miss Layton had taken up her
quarters with her.</p>

<p>"Don't hurry on <i>my</i> account, Miss Clinton;
I have no doubt that Ellie and I can
entertain each other very well, until you
return," replied Miss Layton.</p>

<p>"Very well then, Ella, I shall expect
you to do your best," said aunt Prudence,
as she went out of the door.</p>

<p>"Will you take a walk with me, Ella?"
asked Miss Layton.</p>

<p>"Oh yes, ma'am, I should love to, dearly!<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_113" id="Page_113">[113]</a></span>
I'll get my bonnet in one minute!" exclaimed
Ella, bounding out of the room.
In less than the specified time she returned
with her bonnet in her hand.</p>

<p>"Where shall we go, Ellie?" said Miss
Layton; "the sun is nearly down, so we
cannot take a very long walk before it will
be getting dark."</p>

<p>"Will you come with me to see my
mother's grave, Miss Layton? it isn't very
far, and the grave-yard is very pretty;
there are so many trees, and bushes, and
flowers planted round the graves."</p>

<p>"Yes, Ellie, we will go there, if you
wish it."</p>

<p>"I love to come here since mother died,"
said Ella, as they stood by Mrs. Clinton's
grave. "Sometimes I sit down on the
grass, and lay my head on the grave, and
talk to mother, and it seems as if she could
hear me; but Oh, I wish she could speak to
me! Oh, if I could only put my arms round<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_114" id="Page_114">[114]</a></span>
her neck once more, and give her just <i>one</i>
more kiss!" and Ella burst into tears, and
laid her face against the cold tomb-stone,
while the tears fell like rain on the grass
that covered her mother's breast. Miss
Layton's tears were falling too.</p>

<p>"Your mother is not here, dear child,"
said she. "'Tis only the senseless body that
lies there, but your mother lives in heaven."</p>

<p>"Yes, I <i>know</i> she does, because she was
so good, that I am sure God would take her
there."</p>

<p>"You don't mean, my dear child, that
God would save her <i>because</i> she was good?"</p>

<p>"Why, yes, Miss Layton; it's the <i>good</i>
people that go to heaven, isn't it?"</p>

<p>"My dear Ella, there is <i>none</i> that doeth
good and sinneth not; 'they are <i>all</i> gone
out of the way; they are altogether become
filthy; there is none that doeth good&mdash;no,
not <i>one</i>.'"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_115" id="Page_115">[115]</a></span></p>

<p>"But you said my mother was in
heaven!"</p>

<p>"Yes, my dear, but not <i>because</i> she was
<i>good</i>, but because Jesus died to save her.
'This is a faithful saying, and worthy of
all acceptation, that Jesus Christ came into
the world to save sinners.' If we were
able to save ourselves by our own good
works, then Jesus need not have died. No,
Ella, we cannot do anything <i>at all</i> to <i>merit</i>
salvation, but must accept it as God's <i>free
gift</i>, 'not of works, lest any man should
boast.' 'By their fruits ye shall <i>know</i>
them;' it is not said they shall be <i>saved</i> by
their fruits, but by them they are to be
<i>known</i>; they are the <i>evidence</i> of their acceptance
with God. 'Believe on the Lord
Jesus Christ, and thou shalt be saved:' we
are to be saved by faith, not by works; but
unless we do good works, unless we love
God's commandments and try to keep them,
we have no reason to think we have any<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_116" id="Page_116">[116]</a></span>
faith, for it must be a living faith that saves
us, and the apostle James tells us that
'faith without works is dead.' Your mother
professed to believe on the Lord Jesus
Christ, and she showed by her works that
hers was not a dead faith, and therefore
we may rest assured that she is in heaven;
but if she had expected to be saved on account
of her own good deeds, we could have
had no such assurance concerning her."</p>

<p>"I think I understand it now, Miss Layton,"
said Ella, "and I remember that
mother always seemed to think herself very
wicked, though I don't think I ever saw
her do anything wrong; but she said she
was not afraid to die, because Jesus had
died to save her."</p>

<p>"Yes, Ella, this is the experience of all
true Christians. But come, it is time for
us to be going; it is growing quite dark,
and the stars are beginning to come out in
the sky."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_117" id="Page_117">[117]</a></span></p>

<p>"How pretty the stars are! Miss Layton,"
said Ella, gazing up into the sky; "I
love to look at them. Mother used to like
to look at them too, and she told me that
some of them were great large worlds, a
great deal bigger than ours, and some were
suns with worlds moving around them.
Miss Layton, what is that white streak up
in the sky, that they call the Milky-way?
I asked aunt Prudence the other evening,
and she said, 'Nonsense! go away, and
don't bother me with such silly questions.'
Do <i>you</i> think it's a silly question, Miss
Layton?"</p>

<p>"No, my dear, not at all silly. The
Milky-way is said to be composed of millions
of stars, which, though they are very
large indeed, are at such an immense distance
from us as to appear very small, and
though they are at great distances from
each other, so much farther are they from
our world, that they look to us as though<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_118" id="Page_118">[118]</a></span>
they were quite close together, and the
rays of light coming from such a multitude
of stars, mingle together, and cause that
white appearance."</p>

<p>"How very great and wise God must be,
to be able to take care of so many worlds
at once!" said Ella.</p>

<p>"And remember, Ella, that he not only
keeps all these worlds in their orbits, but
takes the same care of each one of the innumerable
beings which inhabit them, as
though there was but that <i>one</i> for him to
watch over and protect. You recollect
that Jesus said, 'Are not two sparrows sold
for a farthing? and one of them shall not
fall to the ground without your Father.
But the very hairs of your head are all
numbered.' Then we need not fear that
we are too insignificant for God to notice,
or that he will forget us, because he has so
many creatures to care for."</p>

<p>"How strange," said Ella, "that God<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_119" id="Page_119">[119]</a></span>
can see everything, and take care of everybody,
when he has so many, so <i>very</i> many
people to watch!"</p>

<p>"There is another thing I want you to
think of, Ella," said Miss Layton. "Our
little world, compared with the millions of
other worlds, is but as one leaf compared to
all the leaves on all the trees of the forest,
or as one grain of sand to all that
are on the sea-shore; and yet the great
God, who is the Creator and Ruler of all
these mighty worlds, sent his own Son down
to our little earth to suffer, and bleed and
die to save <i>us</i>, who are rebels against him
our Creator and lawful sovereign. 'When
we were yet without strength, in due time
Christ died for the ungodly. God commendeth
his love toward us in that while
we were yet sinners, Christ died for us.'
What <i>amazing</i> love and condescension!
With what wonder and astonishment must
the angels have beheld it! And now, Ella,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_120" id="Page_120">[120]</a></span>
is it not strange that any of us should be
guilty of such <i>base</i> ingratitude, as to refuse
to love this <i>precious</i> Saviour, who has
shown such wondrous love and condescension
toward us? How can <i>you</i> refuse to
give him your heart <i>now</i>&mdash;to forsake your
sins and devote your life to his service? It
is a <i>reasonable</i> service, a service he has a
right to demand of each one of us. And
it is a <i>delightful</i> service; his yoke <i>is</i> easy,
and his burden light."</p>

<p>Things now went on much more smoothly
with Ella; Miss Layton's presence being
a restraint upon her aunt as well as upon
Ella. Miss Prudence still scolded, for she
had indulged the habit so long that it had
become second nature to her to do so, but
not so continually as formerly, and Ella
bore it more patiently.</p>

<p>"How do you get along with this child
at school, Miss Layton?" asked aunt Prudence
one day. "Don't you find her<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_121" id="Page_121">[121]</a></span>
rather unmanageable sometimes? Mr. Burton
used to make great complaints of her,
and I frequently have much trouble with
her myself."</p>

<p>"No, Miss Clinton, I have had very little
trouble with Ella. She is always
obedient, and though she is careless and
quick-tempered, I find that when reasoned
with kindly, she is always sorry for her
faults and anxious to try to do better."</p>

<p>"Well, I don't see why it is that she behaves
so much better for strangers than for
her own aunt. I'm sure I've tried my best
to make a good child of her, but whenever
<i>I</i> reprove her, instead of seeming sorry
for her faults, she is very apt to fly into a
passion. You've no idea how bad she can
be, for she has behaved remarkably well&mdash;that
is, for <i>her</i>&mdash;since you've been in the
house. And yet I can't think it's altogether
because you are a stranger, for she
must have got pretty well acquainted with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_122" id="Page_122">[122]</a></span>
you by this time, going to school to you
every day, and she didn't mind showing out
her badness to Mr. Burton just the same
as to me."</p>

<p>"No, Miss Clinton, I don't think it is
because I am a stranger; I think Ella is a
very affectionate child, and can be very
easily ruled by kindness."</p>

<p>"But you scold her, don't you?"</p>

<p>"I do not speak to her in an angry, impatient
way. If you speak to a child in
the loud, angry tones of passion, it rouses
the same feelings in <i>his</i> breast, and instead
of making him penitent on account of his
misconduct, excites a feeling of rebellion
against your authority. But if you speak
mildly and kindly, in a way that shows him
that you do it for his good, and not because
his faults annoy and provoke you, you will
generally find your admonitions have a very
different effect."</p>

<p>"Well, I don't know; but I think when<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_123" id="Page_123">[123]</a></span>
children are bad, they ought to be scolded;
and whipped too, sometimes."</p>

<p>"They certainly ought to be <i>reproved</i>,
Miss Clinton, but not <i>scolded</i>; at least not
in <i>my</i> sense of the word. Some people, I
believe, include <i>all</i> reproof under that head,
but when <i>I</i> speak of scolding, I only mean
loud and angry, or fretful and unreasonable
fault-finding, and <i>that</i>, I really believe,
never benefitted anybody."</p>

<p>"And you don't whip, either, I suppose,
for most folks think that's worse than
scolding."</p>

<p>"Then, there I differ from most folks,"
said Miss Layton, smiling. "I don't pretend
to be wiser than Solomon, who said,
'Foolishness is bound up in the heart of a
child, but the rod of correction shall drive
it far from him;' and again, 'Chasten thy
son while there is hope, and let not thy
soul spare for his crying.' I think it is
<i>sometimes</i> necessary to use the rod, though<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_124" id="Page_124">[124]</a></span>
not very often; but when all other means
have failed to make a child obey, I do not
hesitate to resort to that. But different
dispositions require different management.
Ella, I think, can be most easily ruled
through her affections; and I had much
rather have the management of such a
child, than of one who requires severity.
Only show her that you love her, Miss
Clinton, as I have no doubt you do, and I
think you will find her easily managed."</p>

<p>"Love her! to be sure I do. She's the
only near relation I have in the world.
There was quite a large family of us, but
James and I were all that lived to grow up;
I was the eldest, and he the youngest, and
I thought the world and all of my brother;
but I never wanted him to get married, for
I couldn't bear to think he should ever care
more for anybody else than he did for me.
However, I think now it's just as well he
did, for though Ella does plague me half to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_125" id="Page_125">[125]</a></span>
death sometimes, I wouldn't be without her
for a great deal."</p>

<p>"If you would just let Ella see, by your
manner, that you do feel such a strong affection
for her, I am quite sure you would
find her much more manageable."</p>

<p>"Oh well, Miss Layton, people must act
according to their dispositions; it never
was my way to show my feelings, and I'm
too old to alter my ways now."</p>

<p>"I think we should never consider ourselves
too old to alter for the better," said
Miss Layton, gently. "We are commanded
to be 'kindly affectioned one toward another,'
and parents are cautioned not to
'<i>provoke</i> their children to anger, lest they
be discouraged.'"</p>

<p>Miss Layton was an earnest Christian;
one whose constant endeavour it was to
glorify her Father in heaven by her daily
walk, and to bring souls to Christ. She
deeply felt her responsibility as a teacher;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_126" id="Page_126">[126]</a></span>
she remembered that she was making impressions
on those young minds and hearts,
not only for time, but for eternity; and
she felt that, when she had done all in her
power for the intellectual improvement of
her pupils, she had performed but half her
duty; for she considered the salvation of
their souls of greater importance than anything
else, and felt that her first duty was
to lead them to the Saviour; and not only
did she pray with, and for them, but she
embraced every opportunity to converse
with them on the importance of the 'one
thing needful,' the necessity of repentance,
and faith in the Lord Jesus Christ. And
her labours were not without fruit. One
evening, Mary Young lingered behind her
young companions, and when Miss Layton
kindly inquired if she wished to speak to
her, she burst into tears, exclaiming, "O
Miss Layton, I am such a sinner! what
shall I do?"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_127" id="Page_127">[127]</a></span></p>

<p>"'If any man sin, we have an Advocate
with the Father, Jesus Christ the righteous.'
'Who his ownself bare our sins
in his own body on the tree.' 'This is a
faithful saying, and worthy of all acceptation,
that Christ Jesus came into the world
to save sinners.' 'Believe on the Lord
Jesus Christ, and thou shalt be saved.'
These are the answers given you in God's
own word, Mary."</p>

<p>"But are they meant for <i>me</i>, Miss Layton?"</p>

<p>"Surely, Mary; why not for you as well
as for another?"</p>

<p>"Because I am so very wicked, and have
put off repentance so long?"</p>

<p>"Jesus said, 'I came not to call the
righteous but sinners to repentance,' and,
'Him that cometh unto me I will in no wise
cast out.'"</p>

<p>"But, O Miss Layton, I am <i>so</i> vile, <i>so</i>
wicked, I've sinned against him so long and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_128" id="Page_128">[128]</a></span>
so often, that I'm not <i>fit</i> to come to him, I
don't <i>dare</i> to come."</p>

<p>"I would not have you think any better
of yourself, Mary. You are just as vile
and sinful as you have said&mdash;yes, even far
<i>more</i> wicked than you think&mdash;but it was
just such as you that Jesus came to call.
Just such ruined, helpless, undone sinners;
and the more you feel your sinfulness, the
more conscious you are of your lost and
ruined condition, the more you feel your
need of him, the more willing he is to receive
you."</p>

<p>"But I am <i>so</i> wicked, my heart is so
hard, and when I kneel down to pray, and
remember what a holy God I am going to
speak to, and that he sees my heart and
knows how hard and full of sin it is, I am
afraid to say one word. I don't <i>dare</i> to
pray, for it seems like mocking him."</p>

<p>"You might well be afraid to come, if
you had to come in your own name, Mary,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_129" id="Page_129">[129]</a></span>
but even you may dare to come in the name
of Jesus, since he tells us that it was just
such sinners he came to seek and to save;
and you need not fear to come, weak and
helpless as you are, for does he not say,
'Let him take hold of my strength that he
may make peace with me, and he <i>shall</i> make
peace with me?' You have no strength to
help yourself, you must just look to Jesus.
Take hold of Christ."</p>

<p>"O Miss Layton, <i>dare</i> I come just as I
am&mdash;with such a hard heart? Must I not
wait till I feel my sinfulness more? I don't
feel half so sorry for my sins as I ought
to."</p>

<p>"Come just as you are, Mary; you will
never grow any better by staying away;
and do you expect to make yourself more
acceptable to God by continuing longer in
rebellion against him&mdash;by continuing to refuse
to obey his command, 'My son, give
me thine heart?'"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_130" id="Page_130">[130]</a></span></p>

<p>"But my heart is so <i>very</i> hard, so unfeeling;
it seems to me that I ought to feel
more sorry for my sins."</p>

<p>"I don't deny, Mary, that you ought indeed
to feel more sorrow on account of your
sins, but that need not keep you from
Christ; if you wait for more feeling, you
will never get it. Come <i>now</i>, just as you
are. '<i>Now</i> is the accepted time, <i>now</i> is
the day of salvation.'"</p>

<p>"But it seems to me there never was
such a sinner; will Jesus receive me?"</p>

<p>"He says, 'Look unto me and be ye
saved, all ye ends of the earth.' He says,
'I will be merciful to their unrighteousness,
and their sins and iniquities will I remember
no more.' And again, 'Him that
cometh unto me I will in no wise cast out.'
Do you doubt his word?"</p>

<p>"O Miss Layton, what must I do?"</p>

<p>"Just go and tell God what you have
been telling me, that you are a lost, ruined,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_131" id="Page_131">[131]</a></span>
helpless, undone sinner, utterly unable to
help yourself, or make yourself any better;
cast yourself entirely upon his mercy,
pleading for salvation only through the
blood and merits of Jesus Christ. He
will not reject you; you need not fear, for
none ever came to him in the appointed
way and was refused. 'I will in <i>no wise</i>
cast out.' You have the word of him who
cannot lie."</p>

<p>"When shall I do it, Miss Layton?"</p>

<p>"Now; this moment; the present only
is yours."</p>

<p>They knelt down, and most earnestly did
Miss Layton plead with God for her young
friend, that he would pardon her sins, that
he would wash them all away in the blood
of the Saviour, that he would enable her
to lay hold by faith upon Christ, and trust
in him alone for salvation. And Mary
prayed for herself, confessing in broken
words, and with many sighs and tears, her<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_132" id="Page_132">[132]</a></span>
great sinfulness, her entire helplessness, and
pleading for mercy only for the sake of
Christ.</p>

<p>From that day there was a marked
change in Mary Young. An amiable girl
she had always been, but now much more
so; so willing to do a kindness to any one,
ever ready to deny herself that she might
give pleasure to others, and so conscientious,
so afraid to do wrong, seeming ever to feel
herself in the presence of God, so meek
and humble, and with a heart so full of love
to Jesus, ever striving to lead her young
friends to a like precious faith. The language
of her heart was,</p>

<h2>CHAPTER VI.</h2>


<p><span class="smcap">The</span> time had come for Miss Layton to
leave S&mdash;&mdash;, as she had only taken the
school for the summer term, and there was
a male teacher engaged for the winter.
Poor Ella was greatly distressed at the
thought of losing her friend. "O Miss
Layton," said she, "what shall I do when
you are gone? I will have nobody to help
me to be good, and nobody to love me."</p>

<p>"Yes, Ella, your aunt loves you very
much indeed; she told me so herself."</p>

<p>"Did she?" exclaimed Ella, looking up
in astonishment, "I thought she didn't like
me at all. She never kisses me, nor tells
me she loves me, like mamma used to do,
and she's always scolding me and telling<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_134" id="Page_134">[134]</a></span>
me what a troublesome child I am. Are
you <i>sure</i> she loves me, Miss Layton?"</p>

<p>"Yes, Ellie, <i>quite</i> sure, and you must try
to believe it and to love her in return.
She means it all for your good when she
scolds you, and you must try to bear it patiently."</p>

<p>"O Miss Layton," sobbed Ella, "how
<i>can</i> I ever be good when you are gone?"</p>

<p>"And why should you not, Ellie, just
as well as when I am here?"</p>

<p>"Because you're patient and kind, and
you seem pleased, and praise me when I do
right."</p>

<p>"Ah Ella, don't you remember the other
day you told me you thought you had been
trying to please God all these weeks that
you have been so good, and I told you then
that I was afraid you were only trying to
please me? And now, my dear child, do
you not see that I was right? A desire to
please your friends, Ella, is a good motive,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_135" id="Page_135">[135]</a></span>
but it is not the best. You must learn to
do right because it <i>is</i> right, and pleasing in
the sight of God. It is easy to deceive
our friends and ourselves, but we cannot
deceive God. He looks at the motives&mdash;at
the feelings and desires of the heart, while
we can see only the outward conduct.
Dear Ella, I wish I could see you a child
of God, striving to please him in all your
ways."</p>

<p>"I do mean to try to be good when
you're gone, Miss Layton; but I know I
can't."</p>

<p>"Not if you try in your own strength,
Ella; but you must ask help of God. Ask
him to give you a new heart, my child&mdash;a
heart that will hate sin, because it is so
displeasing to him&mdash;a heart loving holiness,
and earnestly desiring to please and glorify
God. And if you ask these things with
your whole heart, and in the name and for
the sake of Jesus Christ, God will hear and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_136" id="Page_136">[136]</a></span>
grant your petitions, for he says, 'Ask and
ye shall receive; seek and ye shall find;
knock and it shall be opened unto you.'
And he tells us that he is more willing to
give his Holy Spirit to them that ask him,
than parents are to give good gifts unto
their children.</p>

<p>"You try to please <i>me</i>, Ella, because
you love me; but, O my child, how much
more ought you to love your Saviour! I
have shown you a little kindness, but what
is that compared with what Jesus has done
for you? Think how he left that beautiful
heaven, and came down to our little world,
and suffered, and bled, and died, that he
might save you and me. O Ella, how can
we help loving him with all our hearts, and
striving to please him every moment of our
lives! 'Herein is love; not that we loved
God, but that he loved us, and gave his
Son to be the propitiation for our sins.'"</p>

<p>In a few weeks, Mr. Crane, the new<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_137" id="Page_137">[137]</a></span>
teacher, came, and school commenced again.
Mr. Crane proved to be very much such a
teacher as Mr. Burton, though perhaps not
quite so severe. Unfortunately, Ella was
not at all disposed to like him, nor indeed
anybody who took Miss Layton's place;
and he seemed to take a dislike to her from
the first. Sallie Barnes, too, went to
school again, and seeming to dislike Ella
more than ever, was continually trying to
get her into trouble. There would have
been constant quarrelling between them, had
not Mary Young acted as peace-maker, and
done her best to keep them apart. Mary
tried to take Miss Layton's place to Ella,
and did all she could to encourage her to
industry and attention; and she often
talked to her of the love of Christ, trying
to lead her to the Saviour, and telling her
of the happiness she had found in his service.
Still it was a very uncomfortable
winter to Ella. She did not become quite<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_138" id="Page_138">[138]</a></span>
as careless and indolent as she had formerly
been, nor indulge her temper quite so much,
yet she was bad enough to be often in disgrace,
both at home and at school.</p>

<p>The winter seemed very long, but spring
did come at last, and Ella was busy in her
little garden, and again she planted flowers
on her mother's grave, and went every day
to water them and see how they grew.
One evening, when on her way there, as
usual, she met Mary Young; and they
walked on together.</p>

<p>"Come, Mary," said Ella, when they
had reached the churchyard gate, "come
in with me, and see how pretty my mother's
grave looks; the flowers are all growing so
nicely, and the rose-bush has some buds on
it already."</p>

<p>They went in; but when they reached
the grave, what a scene of desolation met
their view! Some one had been there before
them, and pulled up all the flowers by<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_139" id="Page_139">[139]</a></span>
the roots, trampled them in the dust, and
even cut off the rose-bush close to the
ground. Ella stood a moment struck speechless
with astonishment and dismay, then
bursting into tears, she exclaimed, passionately:</p>

<p>"It was that wicked Sallie Barnes! I
<i>know</i> it was! What a mean, bad, wicked
girl she is! I hate her, so I do; and I
hope somebody will go and tear up all <i>her</i>
flowers, and spoil all her garden, for I <i>know</i>
she did this!"</p>

<p>"O Ellie, Ellie! how can you say
so?" said Mary. "I am very sorry for
you, very sorry indeed; but I did not
think you would have been so wicked, as to
say that you hate anybody."</p>

<p>"Well, I don't care, I ain't half so bad
as she is. I wouldn't have touched her
flowers, and I'd rather she had spoilt all my
garden, or killed my pet kitten, or done
anything than this."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_140" id="Page_140">[140]</a></span></p>

<p>"But you don't know that it was Sallie
who did it."</p>

<p>"Yes, I <i>do</i>. Nobody else would want to
spoil anything of mine. Just see! every
<i>one</i> of my pretty flowers pulled up, and
my poor rose-bush cut down too. Oh! I
can never forgive her!"</p>

<p>"O Ellie, <i>dear</i> Ellie, don't say that!"
said Mary, putting her arms round her.
"Have you forgotten that Jesus said, 'If ye
forgive not men their trespasses, neither
will your Father forgive your trespasses?'
Dear Ellie, think how much more you have
done to provoke God, than Sallie has ever
done to vex and displease you, and how he
has never ceased to bless you; and remember
the Bible says, 'Whosoever hateth his
brother, is a murderer,' and in another
place, 'If he love not his brother, whom he
hath seen, how can he love God, whom he
hath not seen?' O Ellie, it frightens me to
hear you talk so. Just think how <i>wicked</i><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_141" id="Page_141">[141]</a></span>
it is to say you hate anybody and will never
forgive them. What if God should say he
would never forgive you?"</p>

<p>"O Mary, I am sorry I said such a
wicked thing, but I was angry and didn't
think how very bad it was. Won't you ask
God to forgive me and help me to like
Sallie?"</p>

<p>"I will, Ellie, but you must ask him
yourself."</p>

<p>"O Mary, I feel as if I was too wicked
to pray; sometimes I am almost afraid to
say my prayers. I wish I was as good as
you."</p>

<p>"Don't say that, Ellie, I'm not at all
good; if you could see all the sinful
thoughts and feelings that come into my
heart, you would not call me good. I
should often be quite in despair, but then I
remember that 'Christ is the end of the law
for righteousness to every one that believeth,'
and I beg God to wash away my<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_142" id="Page_142">[142]</a></span>
sins in his blood, and clothe me in the robe
of his righteousness. O Ellie dear, there
is no love so sweet, so satisfying, as the
love of Jesus. You are always wanting
some one to love you, why will you refuse
the love of him, who laid down his life for
you? 'Greater love hath no man than this,
that a man lay down his life for his
friend.'"</p>

<p>"I am sure I would like to be a Christian,
Mary, if I only knew how."</p>

<p>"There is nothing to hinder you, Ellie,
if you really wish it. Jesus stands ready and
waiting to save you, and you have nothing
to do but come to him; come <i>now</i>, just as
you are, without waiting to grow any better.
'O taste and see that the Lord is good:
blessed is the man that trusteth in him.'"</p>

<p>"How do you mean, Mary? how can I
go to Jesus?"</p>

<p>"By praying to him, Ellie; praying
with your heart. If you will do so, there<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_143" id="Page_143">[143]</a></span>
is no danger that you will perish, for he
never yet cast out any who came to him in
the right way."</p>

<p>Ella sighed deeply; and sat for some
time looking very thoughtful. Presently
she got up from the tomb-stone, where they
had been sitting, and began picking up the
broken flowers, and putting them into her
basket.</p>

<p>"I shall just throw these away, and
plant some more," said she. "I guess it's
not too late for them to grow. I hope
Sallie will not pull them up again; but if
she does, I hope I shall not get so angry
again as to say that I hate her."</p>

<p>Ella knelt down, as usual, that night
to say her prayers before getting into bed,
but when she came to the petition, "Forgive
us our debts, as we forgive our debtors,"
she stopped, for the text that Mary had
quoted came freshly into her mind, and she
felt in her heart that she had not forgiven<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_144" id="Page_144">[144]</a></span>
Sallie. "Then I can't say that," said she
to herself, "for it would just be asking
God not to forgive me. What shall I do?
I can't say my prayers, and I'm afraid to
go to bed without saying them. Mother
told me never to do that, and besides I'm
afraid I might die before morning."</p>

<p>She sat down to think about it. She
tried to feel that she forgave Sallie, but she
could not; the more she thought about it,
the more she seemed to dislike her. Many
little things had occurred, during the last
few months, to cause this dislike. Sallie
had been continually annoying her in every
possible way, and she felt not the least
doubt that it was she who had destroyed
her flowers&mdash;the flowers which affection for
her mother had prompted her to plant&mdash;and
she felt as if the act was an insult to
the memory of that dearly loved mother,
and therefore much harder to forgive than
any unkindness done only to herself.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_145" id="Page_145">[145]</a></span></p>

<p>"I wish the Bible didn't say, 'Love
your enemies,' for it's so hard to do it.
Sallie is my enemy, and it seems to me I
can't like her; she's so disagreeable, and
always doing something to vex me; but
then it's very true, what Mary said&mdash;I
do a great deal more to displease God,
than Sallie does to vex me. How strange
that he is so good to me! But what shall
I do about my prayers? I'll ask God to
make me willing to forgive Sallie; I can do
that."</p>

<p>She did so, and then got into bed. Still
her conscience was not at rest. She tossed
about for some time, but at length, overcome
with weariness, forgot her troubles in
the sound sleep of childhood.</p>

<p>But the same struggle was to be gone
through again the next morning, and so it
was every night and every morning for
days and weeks, her anxiety and distress
constantly increasing, so that it would sometimes<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_146" id="Page_146">[146]</a></span>
be long, after she had laid her head
upon the pillow, before she could close her
eyes in sleep. But she said nothing of all
this to any one, for Mary Young had left
town for a few weeks on a visit to a friend,
and there was no one else whom she dared
approach on the subject. At length one
night, after tossing on her bed for hours,
unable to bear her distress any longer, she
threw herself upon her knees and earnestly
begged to be enabled to forgive Sallie.
This time she prayed with her whole heart,
and she immediately felt that her prayer
was answered, and that she could forgive
her enemy. Then she prayed for herself,
that her own sins might be forgiven; that
her hard and stony heart might be taken
away, and a heart of flesh given to her&mdash;a
heart hating sin, loving God and desiring
above all things to serve and please him.</p>

<p>She rose from her knees feeling relieved
and calm, and lying down on her bed, slept<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_147" id="Page_147">[147]</a></span>
soundly till morning. Ella waked with the
same feeling of calmness and peace with
which she had fallen asleep, and she found
a pleasure in offering up her petitions, that
morning, which she had never known before.
She found it easy now to forgive
Sallie and to pray for her, and very pleasant
to pray for herself, and she was also
conscious of such a desire to be kept from
sin, and enabled to please God by her conduct
that day, as she had never felt before;
but it did not occur to her then, nor for
some weeks afterwards, that her heart had
been changed. She only knew that she
felt a longing desire to become a child of
God.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>"I have some good news to tell you,
Ellie," said Mary Young, as she came into
Miss Clinton's sitting-room one morning,
where Ella was seated busily engaged with
some sewing. Mary's face was beaming<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_148" id="Page_148">[148]</a></span>
with delight, and she looked as if she
could scarcely wait for Ella to ask her what
her news might be. But she was not kept
waiting long.</p>

<p>"What is it, Mary? do tell me!" exclaimed
Ella. "I'm sure it's something
good, because you look so pleased."</p>

<p>"Yes, indeed, it is good news. Miss
Layton is coming back."</p>

<p>"Oh! is she?" cried Ella, dropping her
work to clap her hands, "Oh, I'm so glad!
I'm <i>so</i> glad!"</p>

<p>"But that isn't all," said Mary. "It's
a select school she's to have, and so she is
to stay all the time&mdash;summer and winter."</p>

<p>"Oh, how nice! and I hope she'll live
with us again."</p>

<p>"What's that you're talking about, Ella?"
asked aunt Prudence, who had just come
into the room.</p>

<p>"Oh, such good news, aunt Prudence.
Miss Layton is coming back, and she is<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_149" id="Page_149">[149]</a></span>
going to teach a select school, and so she
will stay all the time, and I was just wishing
that she would come and live with us
again."</p>

<p>"Well, child, I think you're quite likely
to have your wish. I had a letter from her
this morning asking if I would take her to
board again, and I shall write back that
I'll be very glad to have her, for she's very
pleasant company, and I don't have half
the trouble with you when she is in the
house."</p>

<p>The next week Miss Layton returned to
S&mdash;&mdash;, and became once more an inmate
of Miss Clinton's family, and soon afterwards
she opened her school. It was not
long before Miss Layton noticed a change
in Ella. She never had any of those violent
fits of passion now; she was more patient
and humble, and though she seemed to
care less for praise than formerly, she was
more anxious than ever to do right; she<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_150" id="Page_150">[150]</a></span>
read her Bible more&mdash;not now as a task
or a duty, but because she <i>loved</i> to read it&mdash;and
she was more thoughtful and quiet,
and listened attentively, and apparently
with pleasure, when any conversation on the
subject of religion was introduced in her
hearing.</p>

<p>One evening as they sat together on the
porch, Miss Layton said to her, "Ellie,
what is the matter with you? you have
grown so thoughtful and quiet lately. What
are you thinking about?"</p>

<p>"I was just looking up at the stars,
Miss Layton, and thinking of what you
said to me once about the great love of
Jesus Christ in coming down to our little
world to suffer and die for us, and I was
wishing&mdash;Oh, so much!&mdash;that he would give
me a new heart, and teach me to love him
as I ought."</p>

<p>"If you really wished it with all your
heart, Ellie, it was a prayer; and a prayer<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_151" id="Page_151">[151]</a></span>
that God will hear and grant, for he says,
'Ye shall seek me, and find me when ye
shall search for me with all your heart.'
But don't you love the Saviour, Ellie?"</p>

<p>"Oh yes, Miss Layton, I hope I do. I
love to read about him, to think about him,
and to pray to him; and Oh, I want to be one
of his children! Oh, I wish I could be a
Christian!"</p>

<p>"Dear Ellie, I hope you are one. You
love the Saviour, and want to love him
more; you love to pray to him, to think of
him, and to read and hear about him; you
love the society of his people, and I have
noticed for some time that you seem to be
trying to do right that you may please
God. By your fruits we are to know you,
and judging by them, I hope that with you,
Ellie, 'old things have passed away and all
things have become new.'"</p>

<p>"O Miss Layton, do you think it can
be that I am a Christian? my heart is so<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_152" id="Page_152">[152]</a></span>
hard and full of sin. But Oh, I am <i>sure I
do</i> love Jesus, and I wish more than anything
else that God would make me good!"</p>

<p>And now perhaps you, my reader, are
thinking that all Ella's troubles are over;
that everything will now go on smoothly,
and she will have no more struggles with
pride, indolence, or ill-temper. Alas! you
are sadly mistaken.</p>

<p>The Christian's struggles are not over
as soon as he turns his face Zionward;
nay they are but scarcely commenced. He
has but buckled on his armour for the fight,
but girded up his loins that he may run
the race; for the Christian life is compared,
in the Scriptures, to a race&mdash;to a warfare,
and we are exhorted to so run that we may
obtain, to fight the good fight of faith, to
lay hold on eternal life; and we are told
that "we wrestle not against flesh and
blood, but against principalities, against
powers, against the rulers of the darkness of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_153" id="Page_153">[153]</a></span>
this world, against spiritual wickedness in
high places."</p>

<p>Yes, the Christian's life must be one of
continued warfare against sin and Satan;
for as long as he remains in this fallen
world, so long will his corrupt nature, the
body of sin and death, cleave to him. Yet
he need not despair, for is he not told, "My
grace is sufficient for thee"&mdash;"As thy day
so shall thy strength be"&mdash;"The Lord is
faithful, who will not suffer you to be tempted
above that ye are able, but will with
the temptation also make a way to escape"&mdash;"Nay,
in all these things we are more than
conquerors through him that loved us?"
We are not left to fight alone. Jesus
Christ is the Captain of our salvation.</p>

<p>Many a hard fought battle with her temper
had Ella, and many bitter tears of repentance
did she shed when no eye but
God's could see her; but though at times
she was almost in despair, she still struggled<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_154" id="Page_154">[154]</a></span>
on, crying to God for help, and soon
those about her could see that she daily became
more patient and gentle, more meek
and humble, more Christ-like, more full of
love to Jesus. But aunt Prudence would
not see that it was religion that had changed
Ella so much. She said it was partly because
Miss Layton was there to keep her in
order, and partly because Ella was outgrowing
her faults; that she was getting old
enough to feel ashamed to indulge her temper.
She forgot that her own temper was
quite as bad, as when she was a little girl.</p>

<hr class="chap" />

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_155" id="Page_155">[155]</a></span></p>




<h2>CHAPTER VII.</h2>


<p><span class="smcap">Miss Layton</span> continued to teach in S&mdash;&mdash;
for several years, until Ella was quite done
going to school. When Ella had left school,
she thought she would like to teach, but
aunt Prudence said, "No, there is no need
of your teaching. I have enough to support
us both, and you must stay at home
and learn housework and sewing for a year
at least."</p>

<p>Ella of course did as her aunt wished;
she stayed at home and worked, trying to
do everything just as her aunt wanted it
done; but Miss Prudence was very particular
indeed, and it was often a very difficult
matter to please her. Everything
must be done exactly in <i>her</i> way, or it was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_156" id="Page_156">[156]</a></span>
not done right at all; and sometimes she
would not explain how she wished a thing
done, and then, after it was finished, she
scolded because it was not done exactly her
way. All this was very trying, and Ella
had much need to pray for patience, and
not only to pray, but to watch to keep her
quick temper from getting the better of
her. Daily and hourly she asked God to
help her to 'let patience have her perfect
work,' and to those who knew what an ungovernable
temper she had had in her
childhood, it was really surprising to see
how very patiently she bore with all her
aunt's vexatious ways.</p>

<p>About a year after Ella had quit school,
Miss Layton went away to keep house for
a brother of hers, who had lately lost his
wife. A few days before she left, she and
Mary, and Ella were taking a walk together,
as they had often done before.</p>

<p>"O Miss Layton, I am so sorry you
are going away!" said Ella, sadly.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_157" id="Page_157">[157]</a></span></p>

<p>"But not so despairing, I hope, as <i>little</i>
Ellie was on a former occasion of the kind.
Ah, I cannot call you <i>little</i> Ellie now,
seeing that you are fully half a head taller
than myself."</p>

<p>"No;" said Ella, answering the first
part of Miss Layton's remark, "I am not
despairing, for though very dear, you are
not my best friend now."</p>

<p>"No, dear Ella, and I am glad to know
that I am not. Glad, <i>very</i> glad to know
that you have a Friend who has promised
never to leave nor forsake you, and whose
love will never grow cold; with whom is no
variableness nor shadow of turning, 'Jesus
Christ, the same yesterday, to-day, and for
ever.' How consoling when disappointed
in the affection of earthly friends,&mdash;saddened
by their estrangement, their absence,
or their death&mdash;oh, how sweet to turn to
that love that knows no change; to think
of him who ever liveth, who is ever present,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_158" id="Page_158">[158]</a></span>
and who, having once loved us, will
love us to the <i>end</i>&mdash;of him 'whom having
not seen, we love; in whom, though now we
see him not, yet believing, we rejoice with
joy unspeakable and full of glory!'"</p>

<p>"Dear Miss Layton," said Mary, "we
shall miss you very much indeed. How
many sweet talks we have had together, of
our best Friend, and our heavenly home!"</p>

<p>"Yes, Mary, and when I am gone, you
and Ellie must talk together of these things.
You must 'consider one another to provoke
unto love and to good works.' My dear
girls, I hope you will ever be earnest, working
Christians, striving to bring forth much
fruit, that you may glorify your Father in
heaven. You both profess to be followers
of Christ; you have named the name of
Jesus. Oh, be careful that you bring no reproach
upon that blessed name; be careful to
depart from iniquity, remembering that the
world around you will judge of religion<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_159" id="Page_159">[159]</a></span>
by the influence it has upon your life and
conduct. There can be no such thing as an
idle Christian; we are commanded to 'walk
in wisdom toward them that are without,
redeeming the time,'&mdash;to 'work while it is
called to-day, because the night cometh,
when no man can work.' Then strive ever
to be about your Master's business, use
every talent in the service of Christ, that
in the last great day you may hear the
welcome plaudit, 'Well done, good and
faithful servant, enter thou into the joy of
thy Lord.' Many persons seem to think
that it is only the minister whose duty it is
to labour for the conversion of sinners, but
that is entirely a mistaken notion; the
Bible says nothing of the kind, and it certainly
is both the duty and the privilege
of each and every Christian to labour to
bring souls to Christ.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_160" id="Page_160">[160]</a></span></p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">'Wealth, talent, labour, freely give;<br /></span>
<span class="i1">Spend and be spent that they may live;<br /></span>
<span class="i1">What has your Saviour done for you&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i1">And what for him would you not do?'<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>"And that you may be able to do this, try
to keep your own hearts full of love to him;
pray for his Spirit; read every day, and
meditate upon some portion of his life, and
talk often together of what he has done
and suffered for you, and of those heavenly
mansions he has gone to prepare. 'Then
they that feared the Lord spake often one
to another; and the Lord hearkened and
heard it; and a book of remembrance was
written before him, for them that feared
the Lord, and that thought upon his name.'
Remember, my dear young friends, that
this is not your rest, this world is not your
home. You are strangers and pilgrims
who seek a better country, even an heavenly,
having no more interest in this world,
than a traveller feels in the country through<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_161" id="Page_161">[161]</a></span>
which he is passing, to reach his home;
then be careful that your affections are not
placed upon it, for 'if any man love the
world, the love of the Father is not in him.'
Remember, that you are not your own, and
have no right to live for yourselves; for
you have been bought with a price, even
the precious blood of Jesus Christ, and are
to be a peculiar people zealous of good
works. May the love of Christ ever constrain
you to labour diligently in his
service!"</p>

<p>It was only a few weeks after Miss Layton
had left them, that Miss Clinton lost
nearly all her property, having nothing
left but the house in which they lived, with
a few acres of ground around it. Miss
Prudence, who had always looked upon
poverty as disgraceful, was very much distressed
and mortified by her loss; but she
was of much too active a disposition, to sit
down and waste time in useless fretting.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_162" id="Page_162">[162]</a></span></p>

<p>"I never was rich," said she to Ella,
"but I never was <i>poor</i> before. I never
had to work for my living, but that we'll
both have to do now. I shall move away
to some other place, however, for I'm not
going to stay here to be talked about and
pitied for the change in my circumstances,
by people that know me. I shall just go
off amongst strangers."</p>

<p>Ella would have preferred remaining
amongst friends, but as her aunt did not
consult her at all, she kept her opinions
and feelings to herself.</p>

<p>"Well, well," continued Miss Prudence,
"I do think it's very hard to have to lose
all now, when I'm beginning to grow old.
You don't seem to take it much to heart,
Ella, but I can tell you, you may live to
beg your bread yet."</p>

<p>"Oh no, aunt Prudence," said Ella; "I
have not the least fear of ever coming to
that. Does not David say, 'I have been<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_163" id="Page_163">[163]</a></span>
young, and now I am old, yet have I never
seen the righteous forsaken, nor his seed
begging bread?' And God says, 'Bread
shall be given him; his waters shall be
sure;' and if you are growing old, aunt, I
am young and strong, and can work for us
both; and thanks to you, I have a good
education that qualifies me to teach, and I
have no doubt that I can get a school somewhere;
so cheer up, for I am sure we shall
do finely, and I shall dearly love to be able
to do something towards repaying you for
all the care and trouble you have had with
me."</p>

<p>"You don't know anything about it,
Ella; you've no idea of the evils of poverty,"
said Miss Prudence.</p>

<p>"I know, aunt, that the Bible says, 'A
man's life consisteth not in the abundance
of the things which he possesseth,' and that
we have no need to be unhappy, because
we are poor."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_164" id="Page_164">[164]</a></span></p>

<p>In a few weeks after this conversation
took place, Miss Clinton had found a tenant
for her house, and she and Ella had removed
to a little town, some forty or fifty
miles distant, where they rented two or
three rooms in a small house, and Miss
Prudence took in sewing. Ella had brought
a letter of introduction from her pastor in
S&mdash;&mdash; to Mr. Thomas, the minister, whose
preaching she and her aunt now attended;
and as soon as they were settled, she called
and presented it. Mr. Thomas received
her very politely and kindly, telling her
that he had noticed them in church the
previous Sabbath, and intended calling on
them soon, and then he inquired if there
was anything he could do for her.</p>

<p>Ella told him of her desire to open a
school, asking him if he could tell her of
any suitable room, and if he thought she
could find pupils enough to make it worth
while for her to make the attempt.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_165" id="Page_165">[165]</a></span></p>

<p>He replied encouragingly, saying he
knew of a room that would suit very well,
if she could get it, as he thought it likely
she could, and that he had no doubt she
would soon find scholars enough to fill it,
as such a school as she proposed teaching
was very much needed in the town; adding
that he would go with her now, if she
liked, to see about the room, and to call on
two or three families that he thought would
probably send to her. Ella gladly assented,
and they went; first in search of the room&mdash;which
after some little trouble they succeeded
in securing&mdash;and then to call on the
families Mr. Thomas had mentioned.</p>

<p>As a person introduced by their minister,
Ella was received very kindly by all, and
several promised to send their children if
she should open a school. She returned
home in excellent spirits, to tell her aunt
of her success.</p>

<p>"You seem very much elated, Ella,"<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_166" id="Page_166">[166]</a></span>
said Miss Prudence, "but I warn you that
things won't always look so bright. You
will find enough to damp your spirits even
before you commence your school, and
plenty of trouble afterwards, I'll assure
you."</p>

<p>"I hope you may prove a false prophet
this time, aunt," said Ella, smiling. Miss
Prudence only replied by a shake of the
head, and the next day's experience proved
to Ella the truth of what she had said.</p>

<p>Mr. Thomas had told Ella she ought to
call from house to house inquiring for scholars,
as that was the custom of the place,
and the only way to collect a good school.
She determined to follow his advice, and as
soon as her morning work was done up, she
put on her things, and started out to do so.
To Ella, who was naturally diffident and
retiring in her disposition, this was a very
disagreeable and trying business.</p>

<p>She called at several houses before she<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_167" id="Page_167">[167]</a></span>
found any pupils. Some had no children,
or only those that were too young to send,
and some preferred sending to the public
school, or thought they needed their children
at home.</p>

<p>She was beginning to feel quite discouraged,
when she found herself in front of a
large house which bore the appearance of
the abode of wealth.</p>

<p>"I will go in here," she said to herself,
"they must be rich and <i>able</i> to send their
children, if they have any, and I think I
hear little voices."</p>

<p>She rang the door-bell. A servant appeared,
and in answer to her inquiry for
the lady of the house, ushered her into a
handsomely furnished parlor, where she sat
waiting, what seemed to her a very long
time. At last the lady entered, made a
slight bow, and sat down waiting for Ella
to speak first. Her heart beat quickly.</p>

<p>"I am about opening a school," said she,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_168" id="Page_168">[168]</a></span>
in a timid voice, "and I called to ask, if
you had any children to send."</p>

<p>"Oh, you're the Miss Clinton that I
heard was about starting a school! Yes, I
have three I'd like to send, but how much
do you ask a quarter?"</p>

<p>"Two dollars and a half for little ones,
and for others according to their studies."</p>

<p>"Oh, my! that's too much entirely!
Why there's my Annie has never been to
school in her life, and don't know one letter
from another. I couldn't <i>think</i> of paying
that much for her, and Howard only spells
in two or three letters, and Jane is just beginning
geography. You oughtn't to
charge so much for little ones, for you
know we only send them to get them out
of the way, and we don't expect them to
learn much. Any body can teach A B C
you know, and I think teaching must be
very easy work."</p>

<p>"The little ones are very troublesome,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_169" id="Page_169">[169]</a></span>
you know," said Ella, "and don't you think
it is worth something to have them taken
care of for six hours every day?"</p>

<p>"Well I sha'n't pay any more than a
dollar and a half for my two youngest, and
two for Jane. You must remember that
you're just commencing, and nobody expects
to make anything the first year in any business.
You can't expect to have many
scholars at first, because how are we to
know that you are a good teacher? and
if you want people to send their children,
you'll have to take them very cheap."</p>

<p>"It would not pay at all, ma'am, at the
rate you propose," said Ella; "you must
remember that I have to furnish my room,
and pay my rent, and very soon I will have
to buy fuel. And if I am to have but few
scholars, it seems to me that it's only an additional
reason why I need to ask a good
price."</p>

<p>"Oh, well, you can't expect to make<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_170" id="Page_170">[170]</a></span>
anything the first year; I've often heard
business men say so; but I've told you
what I'm willing to give for my children,
and I sha'n't pay a cent more. If other
people choose to give more, of course they
can do as they please."</p>

<p>Ella sat considering what she had better
do.</p>

<p>"Will you take them for that?" said
Mrs. Wiley, "I want to have it settled at
once."</p>

<p>"Perhaps I had better," thought Ella,
"as I am just commencing, and they are
the first that have offered to-day, though it
will be teaching them for almost nothing,
and we need money sadly; but then anything
is better than nothing. Yes, ma'am,"
she said aloud, "I will take them for that,
as they are the first that have been offered
to-day; though I am sure it is far less than
my labour will be worth."</p>

<p>"Oh well, you mustn't expect to get the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_171" id="Page_171">[171]</a></span>
worth of your labour at first, for, as I told
you before, people never expect to make
anything the first year."</p>

<p>Ella carried a much heavier heart out of
that house, than she brought into it. She
felt so discouraged, so heart-sick, that it
required quite an effort to keep back her
tears, and she felt as if it were almost impossible
to enter the next house. She was
very young, and this was her first trial of
the world. But she remembered that she
was in the path of duty, and sending up a
silent prayer for strength and assistance,
she opened the gate, walked quickly up the
path, and knocked at the door. It was
opened by a pleasant looking lady, who
kindly invited her to come in and take a
seat. Ella sat down, and was hesitating
how to introduce her business, when the
lady remarked:</p>

<p>"You are the Miss Clinton, who is about
opening a school, I believe?"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_172" id="Page_172">[172]</a></span></p>

<p>"Yes, ma'am," said Ella.</p>

<p>"I am very glad of it indeed, for I don't
like to send my children to the public
school; they get into so much bad company
there. What are your terms, Miss Clinton?"</p>

<p>Ella made the same reply she had to
Mrs. Wiley.</p>

<p>"Well, that's little enough, I'm sure,"
said Mrs. Blair, "for I know children are
very troublesome; and I often wonder how
teachers ever have patience to bear with
them. I have four large enough to go, and
I shall send them all, if you will take them.
I hope they'll behave themselves, but if
they don't, you must either correct them
yourself, or let me know. The youngest
is only four years old, but she's a bright
little thing, and I'm sure will learn. Have
you been in to see Mrs. Wiley?"</p>

<p>"Yes, ma'am," said Ella; "she is to
send three, but is not willing to pay much
more than half price."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_173" id="Page_173">[173]</a></span></p>

<p>"What a shame! She's perfectly able
to pay double the price if she chose, for
Mr. Wiley is the richest man in town; but
they are very close, and never pay more
for anything than they are obliged to. But
you ought not to have taken them so low;
the best plan is never to take any for less
than your price, unless they are poor, and
you do it out of charity."</p>

<p>"I did not know what was best," said
Ella, "but I thought as they were the first
that had offered to-day, and I am but just
commencing, perhaps I had better not refuse."</p>

<p>"It may be so, but don't let anybody
else know that you took them for half price,
or they may expect you to do the same for
them. I saw you looked quite down-hearted
when you came in, but you must not get
discouraged; there are some mean people
here as well as everywhere else, but there
are a great many very nice ones too; and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_174" id="Page_174">[174]</a></span>
I have no doubt you will have a very good
school, and do finely after a little."</p>

<p>"Thank you; you are very kind," said
Ella, gratefully.</p>

<p>"Kind words don't cost anything; so I
think we can all afford to give them," replied
Mrs. Blair, smiling.</p>

<p>"Aunt Prudence," said Ella that evening,
half laughing and half crying, "I think I
shall find it a puzzling matter to know how
to manage my school; at least if I try to
please all the parents. One woman told
me her child would have to be petted and
humoured; another, that she wished me to
be very strict with hers. One thinks that
they should play nearly all the time, and
another, that they should have scarcely any
play at all. One says I must never strike
<i>her</i> child; she will never send him where
there is any whipping done; and judging
by what I saw of him to-day, I think it
will be no easy task to manage him, for he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_175" id="Page_175">[175]</a></span>
doesn't mind his mother at all. And lastly,
another woman tells me I <i>must</i> whip <i>her</i>
child, for she knows I can't manage her
without. Now what am I to do?"</p>

<p>"Well, Ella, you must try to do your
duty by them all, and just use your own
judgment about it. It would be impossible
to please all the parents, so you may
just as well take your own way."</p>

<p>"Thank you, aunt Prudence, you have
quite comforted me. I will take your advice;
try to do my duty, and ask God to
give me wisdom, and I know he will, for
he says, 'If any of you lack wisdom, let
him ask of God that giveth to all men liberally,
and upbraideth not; and it shall be
given him.' I am to have some quite large
girls, aunt Prudence; some of them quite
as tall and as old as myself."</p>

<p>"Do you think you can manage them?"</p>

<p>"I don't know, I feel a little nervous
about it, and should feel <i>very</i> much so,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_176" id="Page_176">[176]</a></span>
were it not for the promise I just repeated,
and this other, 'As thy day, so shall thy
strength be.'"</p>

<p>"How fond you are of quoting Scripture,
Ella, you seem to have a text for
everything! You are just like your mother
for that. I don't see how you can ever remember
and think of them all."</p>

<p>"I suppose it must be because they are
so sweet and comforting," replied Ella.</p>

<p>Ella lay awake a long time that night,
arranging her plans for conducting her
school. It seemed to her a very great
undertaking, full of responsibility, and her
thoughts could dwell upon little else for
weeks beforehand. She thought over all
Miss Layton's rules, and her mode of teaching
and of managing her scholars, and
determined to copy her as nearly as possible.
She remembered that Miss Layton always
opened her school with prayer; must <i>she</i>
do that? She shrank at the thought of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_177" id="Page_177">[177]</a></span>
doing so before so many young persons,
some of whom were older than herself.
"But I <i>ought</i> to do it," said she to herself.
"'In all thy ways acknowledge him;' yes,
I <i>ought</i> to do it, and whatever I <i>ought</i> to
do I <i>can</i> do. But I know there are many
teachers who do not,&mdash;perhaps, after all, it
is not necessary. It would be a great
cross to me to do it. I will pray for my
scholars at home, surely that will be sufficient.
No, it will not; I must show them
that I am on the Lord's side, that I am
trying to serve him, and am not ashamed to
have it known that I am his servant. I will
ask God to deliver me from the fear of
man, and help me to forget all but his presence,
that I may not approach him with lip
service, but may come with my <i>whole heart</i>.
Yes, I will acknowledge him in all my ways,
and he will direct my paths."</p>

<p>Ella succeeded pretty well in collecting
a school. She had nearly twenty scholars<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_178" id="Page_178">[178]</a></span>
present on the first day, and, in accordance
with her resolution, she did open her school
with prayer that morning, and every day
afterwards, though for a long time it continued
to be a trial to her to do so. She
found many opportunities to practise patience,
both in teaching and governing her
scholars. Sometimes they were idle, or
dull; sometimes stubborn, mischievous, or
impertinent. Sometimes they came late,
or stayed away altogether, until they were
far behind their classes; and there seemed
to be no end to their carelessness, and forgetfulness
concerning books, inks, pens,
pencils, &amp;c. &amp;c. Then at the end of the
term she found it both difficult and disagreeable
to collect her dues. And these
were not all her trials. She was separated
from her dear Christian friends, Miss Layton,
and Mary Young, and she missed them
sadly. And aunt Prudence's temper had
not been improved by poverty, as Ella was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_179" id="Page_179">[179]</a></span>
often made to feel. But when the weary
day with all its cares and toils was over,
and she could be alone with her Bible and
her best Friend, her heavenly Father,
how sweet it was to cast all her cares upon
him, to tell him all her griefs, her troubles,
her doubts, and her fears, and to ask him
for strength for coming trials!</p>

<p>How sweet to remember 'all his mercies
past, and future good implore!' How sweet
to read his blessed word and call each
promise hers! How sweet was the sense
of pardoned sin&mdash;how sweet to remember
that Christ had kept the law for her, and
suffered the penalty in her stead!</p>

<p>Another, though inferior source of comfort
was found in writing to, and receiving
letters from Miss Layton, and Mary Young.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER VIII.</h2>


<p><span class="smcap">Miss Prudence</span> continued quite unable
to do anything all winter, some of Ella's
scholars dropped off on account of the severity
of the weather, and the man who had
taken her aunt's house failed to pay his
rent. All these causes combined brought
down their resources very much indeed, and
Ella began to economize in every possible
way, while she looked forward to the future
with a good deal of anxiety. She also exerted
herself to sew in the evenings that
she might earn a little more, but she was
generally too weary and sleepy after her
day's work to accomplish much. She did
not fail to ask help of Him who has promised
to be a Father to the fatherless, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_181" id="Page_181">[181]</a></span>
to hear his children when they cry; and
sometimes when she had cast all her cares
upon him, and read the precious promises
of his word, her heart was filled with peace
and joy, and she felt sure that he would
never suffer them to come to want; but
she was a young Christian, and sometimes
her faith was weak, and unbelief would
suggest that perhaps, after all, these promises
were not meant for her; that one so
weak and sinful as she, could hardly hope
she was a child of God; then what right
had she to claim his promises as hers? and
besides, were not Christians sometimes left
to suffer want? and then she was unhappy
indeed.</p>

<p>One day Ella felt very much distressed;
they were almost out of flour, and fuel,
and nearly every other necessary, all her
last quarter's money had been spent, their
rent was due the next day, and her present
quarter would not close for some weeks.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_182" id="Page_182">[182]</a></span>
What was to be done? She had no earthly
friend to go to for assistance, but she carried
her trouble to her heavenly Father.</p>

<p>"Bread shall be given him; his waters
shall be sure. Your heavenly Father knoweth
that ye have need of all these things.
But seek ye first the kingdom of God and
his righteousness; and all these things shall
be added unto you. Take therefore no
thought for the morrow, for the morrow
shall take thought for the things of itself.
Call upon me in the day of trouble; I
will deliver thee, and thou shalt glorify
me. I will never leave thee, nor forsake
thee. Heaven and earth shall pass away,
but my words shall not pass away."
These were some of the promises she found
in his word, and feeling a firm assurance
that he would be faithful to his promises,
she went to her work with a calm and quiet
mind, and a cheerful countenance. "Be
careful for nothing but in everything by<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_183" id="Page_183">[183]</a></span>
prayer and supplication with thanksgiving
let your requests be made known unto God;
and the peace of God which passeth all
understanding, shall keep your hearts and
minds through Christ Jesus." Do you
doubt it, reader? Only make the trial.
"Then shall ye know, if ye follow on to
know the Lord."</p>

<p>Ella returned from school in the evening,
and still there was no apparent prospect of
relief, but she did not feel troubled; she
knew it would come in due time. Her
aunt had no idea how nearly destitute
they were, for Ella had not thought it necessary
to tell her, as she knew it would only
distress her, and could do no good.</p>

<p>Tea was over, the dishes washed, everything
put in order, and Ella had seated herself
with her sewing at her aunt's bedside,
when there was a rap at the outer door.
Ella rose, went into the hall, and opened
the door. Seeing a gentleman standing
before it, she said,</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_184" id="Page_184">[184]</a></span></p>

<p>"Good evening, sir, will you walk in?"</p>

<p>"No, thank you," said he, "I have
hardly time. I cannot account for it, Miss
Clinton, but it has come into my head several
times to-day, that you might be in
want of money, and that I might just as
well pay you for the children's schooling
<i>now</i>, as two or three weeks hence; so I
have brought it round. I suppose you have
no objection?"</p>

<p>"Thank you," said Ella, scarcely able
to command her voice, "I <i>was</i> in need of
it. You are very kind indeed."</p>

<p>"Not at all," said he. "Good evening!"</p>

<p>It was a gentleman who sent her a number
of scholars, and the money he had
brought was more than sufficient to relieve
their present necessities. With a full heart,
Ella thanked the Giver of all good. "Oh,
how could I ever doubt!" she exclaimed.
"Truly he is faithful to his promises!"<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_185" id="Page_185">[185]</a></span>
She now went to her aunt, and told her the
whole story.</p>

<p>As they had only Ella's school to depend
upon, they had quite a struggle to live
through the winter, and several times were
brought to great straits, but help always
came in time to save them from actual
suffering.</p>

<p>As spring approached, there was some
improvement in Miss Prudence's health, so
that she was now able to sit in an arm-chair
through the day, and use her hands a little
in sewing. She had been more silent than
usual for some days; seeming very low
spirited, seldom speaking, and when she
did, always in her very crossest tones.</p>

<p>It was a dark, chilly, uncomfortable
afternoon. Ella was coming home from
school, and as she passed the post-office,
she called to inquire for letters. It was a
long time since she had heard from either
of her friends, and she was anxiously looking<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_186" id="Page_186">[186]</a></span>
for a letter; but there was none, and
she turned away with a heavy sigh. There
are times when the mind seems to partake
of the weariness of the body; when the
spirit sinks beneath its load; when one
feels weary of life&mdash;weary of the constant
struggle for existence, and longs to be done
with the cares and toils, the doubts, fears
and anxieties of this life. So Ella felt to-night,
as she wended her weary way towards
her cheerless home.</p>

<p>"Oh, if I had only one friend to sympathize
with, and encourage me!" sighed she.
"It is so long since I have heard from
either of my dear friends, that I almost
begin to fear that they have forgotten me.
If so, how entirely friendless I am! No,
not <i>friendless</i>; there are many dear, kind,
christian people here, though I do not yet
know them well enough to go to them with
my troubles, and ask for their sympathy;
but have I not a 'Friend that sticketh<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_187" id="Page_187">[187]</a></span>
closer than a brother?' one whose love will
never grow cold; one who never changes;
'Jesus Christ the same yesterday, to-day,
and for ever?'</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">'His love, no end nor measure knows,<br /></span>
<span class="i3">No change can turn its course;<br /></span>
<span class="i1">Immutably, the same it flows<br /></span>
<span class="i3">From one eternal source.'<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>"Oh, how wrong is this feeling of discontent
and weariness; this repining at my
lot, when I know that it is all ordered by
Him who is infinitely wise and good! And
Oh, how many blessings I have, and yet
how unworthy am I of the very least of
them! 'Be content with such things as ye
have, for he hath said, I will never leave
thee, nor forsake thee.' Precious promise!
what more do I need?"</p>

<p>Filled with such sweet and comforting
thoughts, she entered the room where her
aunt was sitting, with a light step and
cheerful face. She was extremely surprised<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_188" id="Page_188">[188]</a></span>
to find Miss Prudence in tears. It was a
sight so unusual&mdash;for it had always been
Miss Prudence's boast that she was above
such weakness&mdash;that Ella thought something
dreadful must have happened.</p>

<p>"Dear aunt Prudence, what is the matter?"
she exclaimed.</p>

<p>"Nothing," said Miss Prudence, turning
away her face.</p>

<p>"Nothing, dear aunt Prudence? I am
very sure it can be no trifle that moves <i>you</i>
so. My dear aunt, we two are all alone in
the world; surely, you will not refuse me
a share in your confidence."</p>

<p>"Go away, Ella! I told you it was
nothing; can't you believe me?" replied
Miss Prudence, angrily.</p>

<p>Seeing that it would be useless to press
the matter farther at that time, Ella left
her aunt, and set about getting tea, her
mind all the time occupied with conjectures
as to what might be the cause of Miss Prudence's<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_189" id="Page_189">[189]</a></span>
trouble. Miss Prudence had never
made a profession of religion, but she often
boasted that she was "quite as good as
any member of the church, and a great
deal better than some of them; for she
read a chapter in the Bible every day, and
went regularly to church twice every Sabbath,
rain or shine, which was more than
some of the members did. She was a good
neighbour, kind to the poor, never cheated
anybody in her life, and always tried to do
as near right as she could; and so she
thought she had about as good a chance of
going to Heaven as any of the rest." Indeed,
she was very much like the Pharisee
who prayed: "God, I thank thee that I
am not as other men are; unjust, extortioners,
nor even as this publican."</p>

<p>Ella had offered up many fervent prayers
on her aunt's behalf, that she might be
led to see upon what a broken reed she was
leaning; that God would open the eyes<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_190" id="Page_190">[190]</a></span>
of her understanding, that she might become
sensible how entirely without merit
were her very best deeds, yea, even needing
to be forgiven, hateful in the sight of God,
because not done from any desire to glorify
him, but from entirely selfish motives; and
that seeing these things to be so, and how
utterly helpless and undone she was, she
might be led to lay hold upon the hope set
before her, and accept of Jesus Christ as
he is freely offered in the gospel, trusting
in his merits alone for salvation. Could it
be that her prayers were about to be answered?
She felt a faint hope that it
might indeed be so. The evening passed
in almost total silence, for though Miss
Prudence seemed restless and ill at ease,
she was not disposed to talk, but appeared
to be occupied with her own thoughts.
Ella was wearied with the labours of the
day, and had been nodding over her sewing
for some minutes, when the clock struck
nine.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_191" id="Page_191">[191]</a></span></p>

<p>"You had better go to bed, Ella," said
Miss Prudence. "There is no use in trying
to sew, when you can't keep your eyes
open."</p>

<p>"I believe I might as well," replied
Ella, folding up her work; "but you will
go too, aunt Prudence, won't you?"</p>

<p>"No; it's no use, for I couldn't sleep,"
said Miss Clinton, leaning her head upon
her hand, with a heavy sigh.</p>

<p>"Do your limbs pain you worse than
usual to-night, aunt?" asked Ella.</p>

<p>"No, child, they're easy enough at present;
but bodily pain is not always the
hardest to bear."</p>

<p>"What is it that troubles you so, dear
aunt? let me at least give you my sympathy,
if I can do nothing more."</p>

<p>Miss Prudence remained silent, but Ella
ventured again to urge her to confide her
trouble to her.</p>

<p>"Ella," she said at last, "I used to say&mdash;and
I <i>thought</i> it too&mdash;that I was quite as<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_192" id="Page_192">[192]</a></span>
good as any of my neighbours, and quite
as likely to go to Heaven as any of those
who made a profession of religion. I considered
myself quite good, and deserving
of salvation; but lately my views and feelings
have changed, and I seem to myself
to be a very great sinner, so hardened and
so wicked that it frightens me to think of
it; for I don't see how it is possible that
such a vile wretch can be saved. I'm afraid
I have sinned away my day of grace, and
I shall go down to hell."</p>

<p>"Dear aunt Prudence, listen to what
God says, 'Deliver him from going down
to the pit; I have found a ransom.' 'This
is a faithful saying, and worthy of all acceptation,
that Christ Jesus came into the
world to save sinners.'"</p>

<p>"But not such sinners as I; remember
how many years I have been turning a
deaf ear to all his invitations; how often<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_193" id="Page_193">[193]</a></span>
he has called, and I have refused. Oh!
these words are constantly ringing in my
ears: 'Because I have called, and ye refused;
I have stretched out my hand, and
no man regarded; but ye have set at nought
all my counsel, and would none of my reproof;
I also will laugh at your calamities,
I will mock when your fear cometh.' O
Ella, I am sure those words are spoken to
me," she added, with a shudder, covering
her face with her hands.</p>

<p>"Dear aunt, he says, 'I will be merciful
to their unrighteousness, and their sins
and iniquities will I remember no more.'"</p>

<p>"It doesn't mean me," she replied, with
a hopeless shake of the head.</p>

<p>"'Come now and let us reason together,
saith the Lord; though your sins be as
scarlet, they shall be as white as snow,
though they be red like crimson, they shall
be as wool.' Dear aunt, those words are
addressed to you as much as to any one."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_194" id="Page_194">[194]</a></span></p>

<p>Miss Clinton shook her head. "They
might have been once, but not now, it is
too late."</p>

<p>"Aunt Prudence, God says, 'I have no
pleasure in the death of him that dieth,
but rather that he turn from his evil way
and live.' 'Turn ye, turn ye, for why will
ye die, O house of Israel?'"</p>

<p>"That's not for me, for I can't turn. I
might have done it once, but now it's too
late."</p>

<p>"Why do you say it is too late, aunt?
Would you limit the power of God? Are
we not told that 'Christ is able to save to
the <i>uttermost, all</i> that come unto God by
him,' and does he not invite you to come?
'Come unto me all ye that labour, and are
heavy laden, and <i>I will</i> give you rest.'"</p>

<p>"But he says, 'My Spirit shall not
always strive,' and I can't expect that he will
ever strive with me again, since I have resisted
him, and grieved him away so often.
No, it is too late."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_195" id="Page_195">[195]</a></span></p>

<p>"Aunt Prudence, I am sure he has not
ceased to strive with you, or you would
not feel the anxiety that you do. I believe
he is striving with you now."</p>

<p>"No, Ella, you have no idea how hard,
how dreadfully hard my heart is. Ella,
fifty years I have lived in rebellion against
God, I have given all my best days to the
world; I did not seek God early, and now
I cannot expect to find him."</p>

<p>"Remember the thief on the cross, aunt
Prudence, saved at the eleventh hour. 'God
is the Lord, the Lord God merciful and
gracious, slow to anger, and of great mercy,
forgiving iniquity, transgression, and sin.'"</p>

<p>"'But who will by no means clear the
guilty,'" added Miss Prudence, "and who
more guilty than I?"</p>

<p>"But aunt Prudence, he says, 'I have
found a ransom.' Jesus says, 'Come unto
me and I <i>will</i> give you rest; you have only
to come casting away every other dependence,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_196" id="Page_196">[196]</a></span>
and he <i>will</i> receive you.' 'Return
unto the Lord and he will have mercy upon
you, and to our God for he will abundantly
pardon.'"</p>

<p>"No, Ella, not me. I have sinned away
my day of grace, and now it is too late;
there can be no more mercy for such a
wretch as I."</p>

<p>"Aunt Prudence," said Ella, "the adversary
of souls, the devil, 'who goeth
about as a roaring lion seeking whom he
may devour,' has long been successful in
making you put off repentance, by persuading
you to trust in a false hope, telling you
that you were as good, and as likely to be
saved as others; and now that he finds that
he cannot make you shut your eyes any
longer to the danger, he would fain persuade
you that it is <i>too late</i> to repent and
seek God. But don't&mdash;Oh! don't listen to
his suggestions. It is <i>not</i> too late. Jesus
stands ready to save you. Oh! come to him<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_197" id="Page_197">[197]</a></span>
now, for he says, 'I will in <i>no wise</i> cast
out.'"</p>

<p>Miss Clinton sat for some time without
speaking, her face buried in her hands,
while Ella was silently lifting up her heart
to God in her behalf.</p>

<p>"Ella," said she at last, "go to bed,
child, and leave me; I wish to be alone
now."</p>

<p>Ella bent over her aunt, and kissed her
forehead, saying in a low tone, "Good
night, dear aunt; remember, 'He is able to
save unto the <i>uttermost</i>.'"</p>

<p>The next morning, Miss Prudence seemed
more composed, but said nothing on the
subject of the last night's conversation, and
there was something in her manner which
kept Ella from alluding to it. Weeks
passed away, and gradually a change
seemed to come over Miss Prudence. She
seemed calm, and even cheerful, was more
patient than Ella had ever known her, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_198" id="Page_198">[198]</a></span>
spoke very gently and pleasantly, and Ella
several times surprised her reading her
Bible, and shedding tears over it; still she
said nothing on the subject for some time.</p>

<p>At length one quiet Sabbath-evening
when they were sitting together at the window,
watching the last rays of the setting
sun, laying her hand on her niece's shoulder,
while the tears trembled in her eyes,
she said, "Ella, I have begun to indulge a
faint, a trembling hope that I have been
born again, that I am changed; that with
me 'old things have passed away, and all
things have become new,' and that when
my Sabbaths here on earth are over, I shall
go to spend an eternal Sabbath in heaven.
Yes, spend it in praising redeeming love,</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">'Amazing love! how sweet the sound<br /></span>
<span class="i3">That saved a wretch like me!<br /></span>
<span class="i1">I once was lost, but now am found,<br /></span>
<span class="i3">Was blind, but now I see.'<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>"And it is to <i>you</i>, Ella, under God, more<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_199" id="Page_199">[199]</a></span>
than to any one else, that I owe this. I
have watched you for years, and have been
astonished to see the careless, proud, self-willed,
passionate child, change to the meek,
submissive, patient, and humble young
Christian. I had often said to myself that
there was nothing in religion, but how could
I doubt it any longer when I saw such
fruits?"</p>

<p>"O aunt Prudence," said Ella, "I
have often felt afraid that <i>I</i> was the stumbling
block in your way that was keeping
you from coming to Christ; for I have come
so very far short in the performance of my
duty, I have shown so little of the spirit
of Christ."</p>

<p>"I know you are not perfect, Ella, but
you are strangely changed, and I can
plainly see that you are trying to serve
God."</p>

<p>"Give the glory where it is due, dear
aunt Prudence; but Oh, how happy I am!<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_200" id="Page_200">[200]</a></span>
I feel as if I had nothing more to ask for,
now that you, my dear aunt, will be my companion
in my pilgrimage. God has heard
my prayers. He is indeed 'the hearer,
and answerer of prayer.' But, aunt Prudence,
you had two much brighter examples
of piety before you, in my mother and Miss
Layton; did not the beautiful consistency
of <i>their</i> lives convince you of the truth and
value of religion?"</p>

<p>"I never knew them until years after their
conversion, and when I was forced to notice
how good and amiable they were, I
said to myself, It is their natural disposition;
but I <i>knew</i> what <i>you</i> were by nature,
so that that excuse did not avail me
then, and I could not but acknowledge to
myself, that nothing but the power of God
could have wrought such a change. And
I bless God for the affliction, with which he
has visited me this winter, for while confined
to my bed unable to do anything, and often<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_201" id="Page_201">[201]</a></span>
with nothing but my thoughts to occupy
me, I seemed to be compelled to think of
my past life, and to consider my latter
end."</p>

<p>During the ensuing summer, Miss Clinton's
health was almost entirely restored.
She also recovered the money she had lost,
and they returned to S&mdash;&mdash;, to their old
home. Mary and Ella were rejoiced to be
once more near each other; able to take
sweet counsel together, to walk together to
the house of God, and together to talk of
their common hopes and joys. All her old
neighbours were surprised to see the strange
change in Miss Prudence. The quiet,
gentle, humble woman that returned to
them, was so different from the loud, boisterous,
proud and passionate woman that
went away, that they knew not what to
make of it. They all agreed that she was
very much improved, but no one enjoyed the
change so keenly as Ella. There was now<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_202" id="Page_202">[202]</a></span>
no discord in her home, but peace and love
reigned in its stead. Aunt Prudence, from
being her greatest trial, had become her
dearest earthly comfort: formerly, they
seemed to have nothing in common; now,</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"Their fears, their hopes, their aims were one,<br /></span>
<span class="i1">Their comforts and their cares."<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>"Aunt Prudence," said Ella to her aunt,
one day a few months after their return,
"the school Miss Layton had when she was
here last, is now without a teacher, and a
gentleman was speaking to me yesterday
about taking it; what do you say?"</p>

<p>"I think you had better not; there is no
longer any necessity for you to exert yourself,
unless you are too proud to depend
upon me."</p>

<p>"I confess that I prefer being independent,
aunt, though I hope it is not <i>pride</i>
that makes me feel so; but setting that
reason aside, I still feel a desire to teach.
I think that scarcely any one has more opportunities<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_203" id="Page_203">[203]</a></span>
for doing good than a christian
teacher, and it is certainly our duty to do
all the good we can; to use every talent
in the service of our Master. 'To him
that knoweth to do good and doeth it not,
to him it is sin.' You know I succeeded
in my first effort so well, that the parents
of my pupils urged me to stay, and continue
my school; I think that proves that
I have a talent for teaching, and if I have,
ought I not to use it?"</p>

<p>"Think of the great, the solemn responsibility,
Ella."</p>

<p>"I have thought of it, aunt Prudence,
and I feel that it is a <i>very</i> great responsibility;
but would I get rid of it by burying
my talent in the earth?"</p>

<p>"But, Ella, you used to come home
looking so miserably tired, so completely
worn out. I don't believe, my child, that
it is your duty to work yourself to death."</p>

<p>"Nor I, either, aunt Prudence; but I<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_204" id="Page_204">[204]</a></span>
don't think it will kill me. You must remember
that <i>then</i> I had the care of the
house in addition to the school; and that
I shall not have <i>now</i>; and besides, as somebody
says, 'I had rather <i>wear</i> out than
<i>rust</i> out,' rather die of too much work than
of too much idleness."</p>

<p>"Well, Ella, if you really are so anxious
to teach, I will not oppose it; but as to
your not liking to be dependent upon me,
what difference does it make whether you
take a part of my money now, or get it all
at my death? for I have no one to leave it
to but you, and it must all be yours at last."</p>

<p>"Don't talk about dying, dear aunt,"
said Ella, with tears in her eyes; "I hope
you have a great many years yet to live."</p>

<p>"If it is God's will, I have no objection,
Ella; but I hope we may both be ready
whenever our Lord shall come; if we are
only prepared, it will make very little difference
<i>when</i> the summons comes. But I<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_205" id="Page_205">[205]</a></span>
did not mean to distress you; I am perfectly
well, and as likely, I suppose, to live
to old age as any one else."</p>

<p>"Well, auntie, may I take the school?"</p>

<p>"Yes, child; if you wish."</p>

<p>So Ella taught school in the same town
and in the very same room where she had
been a pupil herself; and people said she
was very much such a teacher as Miss Layton,
which Ella considered the highest
praise that could have been bestowed upon
her. And she <i>was</i> like Miss Layton in
her patient, gentle manner towards her
scholars, and her earnest efforts to lead
them to Christ.</p>

<p>"By their <i>fruits</i> ye shall know them."
Reader, what kind of fruit are <i>you</i> bearing?
"A good tree cannot bring forth evil fruit,
neither can a corrupt tree bring forth good
fruit." Judged by your fruits, what are
you? A good or a corrupt tree? Are you
a careless, unconcerned sinner walking in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_206" id="Page_206">[206]</a></span>
the broad road that leads to eternal death?&mdash;or
are you treading the strait and narrow
way that leads to life everlasting? Are you
taken up with the things of <i>this</i> world,
living only for the present moment, careless
of the interests of your immortal soul, and
unconcerned about the forgiveness of your
sins? Are you a slave to the law, trying to
work out a salvation of your own, and
merit heaven by your own good works?&mdash;or
are you a loving child, serving a tender and
beloved Parent, striving to bring forth much
fruit, that you 'may glorify your Father
which is in heaven?' "Behold what manner
of love the Father hath bestowed upon
us, that we should be called the sons of
God."</p>
